2024-11-01,GLD,investing,post,1gh95em,,,Barrick and Newmont signaling local top in gold,"Barrick and Newmont signaling local top in gold
Because of Fed reserve balance sheet, gold/oz reaching $4,000 is highly likely. However, Barrick and Newmont are both signaling either increased costs (inflation) or lower/stale gold prices for the near term. I think gold will become another buying opportunity within the next 6 months for another \~80% monster run.

Gold is in that periodization in its near 15year cycle where it usually ends with a blow-off top.

Barrick is my preferred gold miner; better assets and more copper and it tends to trade with copper at times more than gold. Copper is looking bullish here which offset miner's costs so I lean toward gold per ounce coming down going into next year, possibly until Feb-March which is gold price season due to seasonal mines being offline.","Because of Fed reserve balance sheet, gold/oz reaching $4,000 is highly likely.

\- Rotate more into treasuries, intermediate term maybe 7-10 years (get through the next great recession.)  
\- And a good chunk of TIPS for inflation protection.   
\- Keep a large liquid pool, including a large insured cash balance, and large money market (and watch out for 'break the 1'. Are there ratings on money markets so I can choose the highest quality?). Look for opportunities during the great recession.  
\- Probably stick with the utilities ETF's and other defensive, maybe allocate more to defensive (consumer staples). I know inflation could cause the utilities ETFs to stagnate or go down, but the dividends should be safe in that regulated market until recovery.

1) I consider the Fed balance sheet the most important driver of gold price. The US uses JPM as its primary gold trader, and the US treasury sold what essentially are warrants or covered calls on gold to the Federal Reserve at a statutory price of $42.22/oz.

2) This means the Federal Reserve has the right to call back the gold at a price of $42.22/oz

3) This would be useful in financing the Federal Reserve Liabilities. If you want to ""fully pay for"" the Federal Reserve Notes in circulation then you get a price of approximately $4,000/oz after the recent money printing due to COVID.

The Fed, Treasury and the US does care about this; they aren't nearly as ""destructive"" as politics would make it seem. They are very good money managers, and so utilizing JPM the US is in process of raising the gold price to offset the cost of existing money supply.

The stock is down this week, and I'm convincing myself this is a buy-the-dip moment.

The reason for the dip is not revenue, which beat expectations. It is because the forecast from analysts for the *next* quarter is above the *company*'s expectation. But this does not concern me because of how close the numbers are. Analysts expect 75.5 B in revenue, the company expects 75.

This ratio would be maintained in a scenario where my spouse expects me to make $100K in a year, but I only make $99,337.74. This difference is equal to the amount I would pay in taxes if I made only $17,118.75 for the **year**. To me this indicates that the analysts and the company are in complete agreement. Therefore, the stock should not be volatile based on analyst-vs-company expectations. But it is?

Am I crazy, or is this dip insane? Definitely time to buy.

2024-11-02,GLD,wallstreetbets,post,1ghnclj,,,SMCI Bull Thesis,"SMCI Bull Thesis
I have been a Debbie Downer in regards to SMCI for pretty much the whole year. The mods on a sub devoted to SMCI  have had their fill of my negative outlook on SMCI telling  all to sell from $800 down to $400 and below.  I am not upset at the mods for calling me names and saying I have mental health issues…for I am a changed man and have seen the error of my ways! With great thought I have taken a deep dive to truly understand the bull thesis on this stock. Let’s consider what the positives are at the moment:

1. **The fall from the March high of $1200**. Before the split that would be a drop from \~$1200 to $250 roughly a 80% loss in value. Bull Thesis…well after the split the numbers don’t look as bad. 1200 to 250 seems huge when compared to 120 to 25. So the drop now was only $95 vs $950. Psychologically better for a bull thesis when you look at this way…less room to climb!
2. **SMCI has made a complete u-turn to where it traded this time last year:** $1200 back to $250. Bull Thesis: history may repeat itself and you can do this all over again and not make the mistakes you did last time. 
3. **Low cost of entry.** Bull Thesis: If you wait a little bit to buy you may be able to get it at $10.
4. **Hindenburg Report**: Since the report came out two months ago the stock has sold off dramatically. Bull thesis: These claims have not been proven or even discussed by Charles Lang! His silence can only mean these are not true and not worth his time to discuss with shareholders. It is honorable of him to take our time into consideration and not force us to read a statement or watch a video explanation regarding the report. 
5. **10k has yet to be filed**. Bull Thesis: No one knows what the status is... so as far as we know it is a fantastic report. 
6. **DOJ probe**: Bull Thesis: Everyone knows that the DOJ probes almost every tech stock. There hasn't been much word about this lately, so it probably means the government just forgot about it and it is time to buy calls.
7. **EY resigning:** this one is simple. Bull Thesis: The EY resignation means Charles can save money and hire his cousins or other family member’s accounting firm for half the price.
8. **SEC delisting:** Well this one depends on the accounting firm. Bull Thesis: If Charles indeed does have a family member do the audit then the numbers will be golden, delisting averted and it is time to buy calls. 
9. **SP500:** If SMCI is kicked out of the SP500 then it is just 4 more quarters of growth to get back in and the stock will hit $120 again!

So in closing: Sure there are at least 9 items here that are a black cloud hanging  over SMCI. Sure other stocks don’t have these issues and are rallying to all time highs in the most bullish part of the year. Sure, you could sell and put your money in any of these others stocks and not have all these risks. But I see now if I just opened my mind and changed the way I think about SMCI there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. This whole time I should have done what most of the sub was doing…buy at ATH’s and DCA! I wasted almost a whole year not dollar cost averaging and now the stock is 80% below the March highs. I missed out on all that.","I have been a Debbie Downer in regards to SMCI for pretty much the whole year.

The flagship Segilola open pit will be exhausted by 2028, but it can be extended to 2031-2033 if all the satellite assays are mined and the underground quartz-pegamatite veins are excavated. During that period the company seeks to open the second, larger Douta mine in Senegal; it just recently purchased 100% interest in the Guitry exploration project from Endeavour Mining, located in Cote D'Ivoire. The angle is to get in early before all three projects are simultaneously running, then have the market rerate the company's value as gold continues to rise. 

I don't have a price target right now. I'm waiting for completed drilling samples and geochemical analysis on the Guitry project.

During that period the company seeks to open the second, larger Douta mine in Senegal; it just recently purchased 100% interest in the Guitry exploration project from Endeavour Mining, located in Cote D'Ivoire. The angle is to get in early before all three projects are simultaneously running, then have the market rerate the company's value as gold continues to rise. 

I don't have a price target right now. I'm waiting for completed drilling samples and geochemical analysis on the Guitry project. That will give a rough idea of what kind of deposits are in the area, which would allow a preliminary NAV calculation of the entire company.",1,,,,reddit

I read this about counterparty risk with authorized participants. Would this bother you, and could it be avoided by buying a gold mutual fund instead? The second article talked about the risk in London. I don't know how this might apply to gold held in other countries. I am based in Japan and have the option of buying an ETF that holds all the gold inside Japan. Are the risks below universal for all physical gold ETFs regardless of the country?

""He added: “Unlike physical gold, ETFs have counterparty risk, because there’s a possibility that the other parties, such as the Authorized Participant (AP), the trustee or others, may default or fail to uphold their part of the agreement.”

Barisheff argued that, with the recent increased popularity of ETFs, many investors assume they are like open-end mutual funds, but with much lower management fees, and that “Wall Street has become generous”. Investors need to understand the difference, he said, to realise the benefits of an open-end mutual fund trust, such as the BMG mutual funds.""

""This matters because investors naturally expect custodians to be properly regulated. It also matters because the bullion market settles through a separate entity called London Precious Metals Clearing Limited (lpmcl.com) owned by five LBMA members, including the two custodians for GLD and SLV. LPMCL is therefore at the heart of the London bullion market.

Because the bullion market in London is over-the-counter, bullion banks are exposed to counterparty risk, unlike traders on a regulated market. And if a big bullion bank fails, which is certainly possible in a global banking crisis, all the bullion held by the members of the LPMCL both for themselves and their clients could become available to central banks managing the crisis through the Bank of England.

In a systemic meltdown it may be naïve to expect central banks to fully respect property rights. So GLD and SLV are only suitable for investors prepared to accept a lower standard of custodial regulation, and who look to benefit from a rising gold or silver price until they decide to take their profits. They are definitely not for those seeking a safe haven or hedge from a financial crisis.""

Hi there, I'm Eli, a seasoned and Web3 marketer with 4 years of hands-on experience understanding the marketing needs of web3 projects. After working with various projects, I've identified a core challenge in the space: the lack of active, engaged communities and the struggle to gain visibility among potential users and buyers.



That's why I decided to create a business that solves this issue head-on. Our solution is a CommunityFi platform designed to empower both Web3 and traditional projects to reach wider audiences, convert visibility into meaningful engagement, and build vibrant, active communities.



Currently, we’re seeking an angel investment of $20,000 to help us finalize our branding and start building our community. This initial funding will position us for a successful pre-seed round. We already have a strong team in place and a wide network of connections ready to support our launch.



As an early investor, you’ll play a critical role in making this vision a reality. In return, we're offering generous company shares and token allocations, more favorable than what future investors will receive. We also believe in rewarding those who can connect us to additional opportunities—so, if you know someone who might be interested, we’re open to offering incentives for valuable introductions.



Our project has both B2B and B2C applications and addresses a fundamental need in today’s market. As the saying goes: ""When everyone digs for gold, sell shovels."" We aim to be the shovel for projects looking to scale and engage their communities.



Please feel free to reach out if you're interested or know someone who might be.



Thanks so much,

It has a moderate risk profile, but the convexity is highly skewed towards the reward side.

The standout problem in the back half of 2023 was the ore grade. [If you look at the resource model page in their Q3 presentation](https://thorexpl.com/site/assets/files/2777/thor_corporate_presentation_v20_09_24-oct.pdf), the pit has a 4.05 g/t average but 95% of the high-grade assays are 60 meters or deeper.

Now they're slowly returning to excavating those high-grade deposits along with falling AISC. You can see the fluctuations in ore grade in the mining section of the 10-Qs.

> Also the (perceived) very short life left on Segilola probably makes people look for alternatives.

Short life compared to a 10-15 year mine, but the ore grade is 8x the cutoff point for open pit profitability. As open pit is the cheapest means of producing gold, they get massive leverage with every increase in gold's price. It's a unicorn mine in that sense.","> I think once we see some form of capital being returned to stockholders the stock will rerate at least a bit.

🚨 Potential earnings play and/or Long term play 🚨 **ER Report Nov 6 after Close**

**Comparison to Peers**

Listen up, degenerates, because $ELF is the real Cinderella story in the beauty game, and it's about to leave its competition in the dust.  While Estée Lauder ($EL) is looking tired with a -2% revenue growth, $ELF is sprinting with a **33%+ revenue growth** year over year.  And get this: $EL is still carrying a forward P/E of **35** while growing backward, yet $ELF is only trading at a forward P/E of **33** despite actually **blowing up the market**.  If the market's willing to throw a 35x multiple at a beauty dinosaur, what’s stopping $ELF from going for a **100x** multiple, given it's growing faster than most tech stocks?  ELF recently closed around $103 but it has run up $116 just the day before -- its ready to run up. If ELF can show it can grow each quarter in this economy against its competitors like EL, who has a long recognized brand, more funds are going to buy in. With momentum like this, $ELF may be back to the **$200s** by year-end. And if not, the ER Report for Q4 may do it because of the Holiday spending. More people are going to purchase ELF gift sets and/or products over the luxury makeup / skincare for their wife, daughters, and even men because of their high quality skin products (seriously their skincare is highly rated and its not just the low price point).

**Why the sell off? ULTA & Sector**

There was a huge sell off recently because the ULTA CEO gave a “warning” about a possible slowdown in the beauty industry. Also, EL reported last week and it was not well received, it dropped about 20 points from 80s to 60s. The sector is down generally -- but remember ELF is not like ULTA even though it trades alongside it. Just last quarter, $ELF didn’t just meet expectations—it **obliterated** them. The company reported monster earnings, showing that while the rest of the industry might be dragging, $ELF is charging full steam ahead. 

**ELF has the absolute best Dupes for Luxury Makeup**

Let's face it, luxury brands like $EL are out of touch. Estée Lauder's Patrick Ta collection just launched a 2-color eyeshadow duo for $46.  Compare that to $ELF, which dropped a similar duo for just $12 ($6 each with fantastic pigmentation compared to the Patrick Ta at $23 each) — and influencers agree ELF works better (In fact, there was so much controversy about the comparison on [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@mikaylanogueira/video/7429002981216931118), it actually drew up more sales for the duped ELF eyeshadows when famous influencer made a video about the two eyeshadows side by side on, and she said ELF was better.  A ""dupe"" is slang for a product that closely resembles or imitates another, typically a more expensive or luxury item, but is offered at a much lower price. In the beauty and fashion world, for example, a ""dupe"" might refer to a budget-friendly version of a high-end makeup product or designer handbag that has similar qualities or aesthetics. Essentially, it's a way for consumers to achieve a similar look or effect without breaking the bank!

**Affordable & Good Quality Makeup Wins in the Current Economy**

In this tough economy, consumers are flocking to quality, affordable beauty products, not luxury lipsticks costing $75  (ELF literally has $5 lip oils that sell out each restock on popular shades with product availability nearly everywhere target/walgreens/Amazon/Walmart/TJX).  With $EL’s refusal to lower prices and prioritize shelf space, they’re setting themselves up for a fall.  Meanwhile, $ELF is crushing it by prioritizing affordability and accessibility, grabbing market share from legacy names like Covergirl and Maybelline quarter after quarter. And let’s not forget Christmas sales!

But wait … Don’t get hard just yet.  $ELF isn’t just slinging lip gloss and eyeshadow — they’re going all-in on skincare and brushes too, and it’s time to take notice.  These products are like the perfect wingman for your makeup game.  Their skincare line is **affordable as hell**, and let’s be real: who doesn’t want to slather on some quality stuff without having to mortgage their house?  Also, Target’s **Stanley cup x ELF lip holder** flew off shelves just last week, proving $ELF has massive demand and knows how to drive hype.  Below are literal screenshots I just took right now -- SOLD OUT on elf website & ALL ofTarget! Also, because I'm a freak, I peeped ELF subreddit discussions of ELF fans waiting for the restock -- translation, more $$$$ for you!

[SOLD OUT on ELF Website](https://preview.redd.it/a6m8wwlbllyd1.jpg?width=2348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e82657467beea33f01fa7f441995e101d019f164)

**ELF Brand Recognition may lead to more Market Dominance Overtime**

Additionally, $ELF is crushing it on Instagram and TikTok, flexing some serious engagement that proves their marketing game is **on point** and resonates with the crowd.  Now, do yourself a favor and check out $EL's social media right now — spoiler alert: it's a ghost town over there, with tumbleweeds rolling through, and they don’t even have a comment section. It’s like they know nobody gives a shit about their products.  Then, Go hop on $ELF's Instagram and check out any post you want, then compare that to $EL’s sad little corner of the internet.  With that said, here’s the thought that popped in my mind  💡 : $ELF is set to build way more brand recognition over time with Gen-Z than $EL ever will. Let’s be real — $EL is for the golden girls (RIP Betty White, who probably rocked EL to the grave; but your wife rocked ELF last night with her boyfriend). 

Oh, and in case you didn’t know, $ELF products are all over YouTube, getting stacked up against luxury brands by viral influencers—and 9 times out of 10, $ELF comes out on top. Why? Simple: unbeatable quality at a price that doesn’t make your wallet cry. To put it bluntly, there’s probably at least one $ELF product in every woman’s purse or bathroom right now, more than $EL or any other brand. $ELF is like the McDonald’s of beauty—if McDonald’s served gourmet that tasted as good as fine dining. Okay, maybe I’m bad at metaphors, but you get the point.

$ELF’s growth over the past five years? **A massive 300%+** in cumulative sales.  They’re dominating at the low-end price point, appealing to a younger, savvy audience that values quality without the designer price tag. Wall Street has been waiting to see them hit that **30% market share** mark, and now that they’re right there, it’s full rocket fuel from here.  $ELF’s ability to undercut competitors and offer better value has positioned them as the dark horse in the beauty industry.  This year’s 29% slide in the stock? Nothing but a buying opportunity as they’ll likely **top earnings** and turn that loss around.

**Great Leadership**

Tarang Amin, CEO of e.l.f. Beauty, has an impressive track record of driving growth and innovation for over 30 years. Since taking the helm in 2014, he’s transformed $ELF into one of the fastest-growing beauty brands, with a focus on affordable, high-quality products that resonate with younger consumers.  Under Amin’s leadership, $ELF has expanded its reach through savvy digital marketing and influencer partnerships, leading to strong engagement on platforms like Instagram and TikTok.  Looking ahead, Amin plans to continue pushing $ELF’s dominance by investing in skincare, makeup, and new collaborations, aiming to keep the brand relevant and accessible while capturing even more market share.  $ELF is staking its claim on the beauty world like Columbus charting new America—only this time, the territory is more market share, and you are Queen Isabella I of Spain who sponsored the voyage to the Americas (I recently read a book on the four voyages and I feel compelled to link it somehow to stonks).

**Conclusion: Gain and Disrupt**

The beauty sector is primed for disruption, and $ELF is leading the charge. It’s no longer about prestige — it’s about performance, price, and connecting with the average consumer. While $EL and others are resting on big names, $ELF is stealing the spotlight, leveraging strong influencer reviews and aggressively expanding shelf space. We’re witnessing one of the **fastest-growing public companies in the world** for a reason. Earnings don’t always tell the full story, but with $ELF's market takeover, it’s clear: **nowhere but up from here**.

My Position: 130 shares @ 105 & adding more if drops below on tues; Looking for PT 150+ by EOY

**TLDR**: Your wife is using $ELF when shes with her boyfriend 🚀 $EL’s products? They’re what your grandma buys when she’s too busy browsing Macy’s clearance rack to realize the rest of the world moved on.

The company reported monster earnings, showing that while the rest of the industry might be dragging, $ELF is charging full steam ahead. 

**ELF has the absolute best Dupes for Luxury Makeup**

Let's face it, luxury brands like $EL are out of touch. Estée Lauder's Patrick Ta collection just launched a 2-color eyeshadow duo for $46.  Compare that to $ELF, which dropped a similar duo for just $12 ($6 each with fantastic pigmentation compared to the Patrick Ta at $23 each) — and influencers agree ELF works better (In fact, there was so much controversy about the comparison on [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@mikaylanogueira/video/7429002981216931118), it actually drew up more sales for the duped ELF eyeshadows when famous influencer made a video about the two eyeshadows side by side on, and she said ELF was better.  A ""dupe"" is slang for a product that closely resembles or imitates another, typically a more expensive or luxury item, but is offered at a much lower price. In the beauty and fashion world, for example, a ""dupe"" might refer to a budget-friendly version of a high-end makeup product or designer handbag that has similar qualities or aesthetics. Essentially, it's a way for consumers to achieve a similar look or effect without breaking the bank!

**Affordable & Good Quality Makeup Wins in the Current Economy**

In this tough economy, consumers are flocking to quality, affordable beauty products, not luxury lipsticks costing $75  (ELF literally has $5 lip oils that sell out each restock on popular shades with product availability nearly everywhere target/walgreens/Amazon/Walmart/TJX).  With $EL’s refusal to lower prices and prioritize shelf space, they’re setting themselves up for a fall.  Meanwhile, $ELF is crushing it by prioritizing affordability and accessibility, grabbing market share from legacy names like Covergirl and Maybelline quarter after quarter. And let’s not forget Christmas sales!

But wait … Don’t get hard just yet.  $ELF isn’t just slinging lip gloss and eyeshadow — they’re going all-in on skincare and brushes too, and it’s time to take notice.  These products are like the perfect wingman for your makeup game.  Their skincare line is **affordable as hell**, and let’s be real: who doesn’t want to slather on some quality stuff without having to mortgage their house?  Also, Target’s **Stanley cup x ELF lip holder** flew off shelves just last week, proving $ELF has massive demand and knows how to drive hype.  Below are literal screenshots I just took right now -- SOLD OUT on elf website & ALL ofTarget! Also, because I'm a freak, I peeped ELF subreddit discussions of ELF fans waiting for the restock -- translation, more $$$$ for you!

**ELF Brand Recognition may lead to more Market Dominance Overtime**

Additionally, $ELF is crushing it on Instagram and TikTok, flexing some serious engagement that proves their marketing game is **on point** and resonates with the crowd.  Now, do yourself a favor and check out $EL's social media right now — spoiler alert: it's a ghost town over there, with tumbleweeds rolling through, and they don’t even have a comment section. It’s like they know nobody gives a shit about their products.  Then, Go hop on $ELF's Instagram and check out any post you want, then compare that to $EL’s sad little corner of the internet.  With that said, here’s the thought that popped in my mind  💡 : $ELF is set to build way more brand recognition over time with Gen-Z than $EL ever will. Let’s be real — $EL is for the golden girls (RIP Betty White, who probably rocked EL to the grave; but your wife rocked ELF last night with her boyfriend). 

Oh, and in case you didn’t know, $ELF products are all over YouTube, getting stacked up against luxury brands by viral influencers—and 9 times out of 10, $ELF comes out on top. Why? Simple: unbeatable quality at a price that doesn’t make your wallet cry. To put it bluntly, there’s probably at least one $ELF product in every woman’s purse or bathroom right now, more than $EL or any other brand. $ELF is like the McDonald’s of beauty—if McDonald’s served gourmet that tasted as good as fine dining. Okay, maybe I’m bad at metaphors, but you get the point.

$ELF’s growth over the past five years? **A massive 300%+** in cumulative sales.  They’re dominating at the low-end price point, appealing to a younger, savvy audience that values quality without the designer price tag. Wall Street has been waiting to see them hit that **30% market share** mark, and now that they’re right there, it’s full rocket fuel from here.  $ELF’s ability to undercut competitors and offer better value has positioned them as the dark horse in the beauty industry.  This year’s 29% slide in the stock? Nothing but a buying opportunity as they’ll likely **top earnings** and turn that loss around.

**Great Leadership**

Tarang Amin, CEO of e.l.f. Beauty, has an impressive track record of driving growth and innovation for over 30 years. Since taking the helm in 2014, he’s transformed $ELF into one of the fastest-growing beauty brands, with a focus on affordable, high-quality products that resonate with younger consumers.  Under Amin’s leadership, $ELF has expanded its reach through savvy digital marketing and influencer partnerships, leading to strong engagement on platforms like Instagram and TikTok.  Looking ahead, Amin plans to continue pushing $ELF’s dominance by investing in skincare, makeup, and new collaborations, aiming to keep the brand relevant and accessible while capturing even more market share.  $ELF is staking its claim on the beauty world like Columbus charting new America—only this time, the territory is more market share, and you are Queen Isabella I of Spain who sponsored the voyage to the Americas (I recently read a book on the four voyages and I feel compelled to link it somehow to stonks).

**Conclusion: Gain and Disrupt**

The beauty sector is primed for disruption, and $ELF is leading the charge. It’s no longer about prestige — it’s about performance, price, and connecting with the average consumer. While $EL and others are resting on big names, $ELF is stealing the spotlight, leveraging strong influencer reviews and aggressively expanding shelf space. We’re witnessing one of the **fastest-growing public companies in the world** for a reason. Earnings don’t always tell the full story, but with $ELF's market takeover, it’s clear: **nowhere but up from here**.

My Position: 130 shares @ 105 & adding more if drops below on tues; Looking for PT 150+ by EOY

**TLDR**: Your wife is using $ELF when shes with her boyfriend 🚀 $EL’s products? They’re what your grandma buys when she’s too busy browsing Macy’s clearance rack to realize the rest of the world moved on.

Hi there, I'm Eli, a seasoned crypto and Web3 marketer with 4 years of hands-on experience understanding the marketing needs of blockchain projects. After working with various projects, I've identified a core challenge in the space: the lack of active, engaged communities and the struggle to gain visibility among potential users and buyers.



That's why I decided to create a business that solves this issue head-on. Our solution is a CommunityFi platform designed to empower both Web3/crypto and traditional projects to reach wider audiences, convert visibility into meaningful engagement, and build vibrant, active communities.



Currently, we’re seeking an angel investment of $20,000 to help us finalize our branding and start building our community. This initial funding will position us for a successful pre-seed round. We already have a strong team in place and a wide network of connections ready to support our launch.



As an early investor, you’ll play a critical role in making this vision a reality. In return, we're offering generous company shares and token allocations, more favorable than what future investors will receive. We also believe in rewarding those who can connect us to additional opportunities—so, if you know someone who might be interested, we’re open to offering incentives for valuable introductions.



Our project has both B2B and B2C applications and addresses a fundamental need in today’s market. As the saying goes: ""When everyone digs for gold, sell shovels."" We aim to be the shovel for projects looking to scale and engage their communities.



Please feel free to reach out if you're interested or know someone who might be.



Thanks so much!

I still recall from the late 90’s often hearing radio commercials for web sites, that were primarily targeting potential investors.

The companies I listed above, Google, Amazon, etc were focused on building lasting companies and services.

The only plays I can envision with a decent room for runup: 

For a Trump win, 
- (short term buy) DJT. Thesis is straightforward. Trump wins, the stock is a direct way to give the president money. Long term I wouldn’t hold due to serious uncertainty and the odds he sells out his stock. 
- I’m selling individual stocks that may be overexposed to incoming tariffs (like Apple). (Note, I would be buying index funds that contain these stocks. I still believe in the stock but want to avoid heavy individual exposure. ) 
- I already established a Gold position. I think that’s a good short-mid term hedge against a Trump win. 
- Per the speaker of the house comments, the Chips act is at risk if Trump wins. I’d invest in chip exposure abroad (already have ASML and would build there). 

For a Kamala win:
- continue buying my current portfolio. Status quo remains the same so no big change needed. Less urge to sell individual plays. 
- weed legalization is on the table, there are a number of weed stocks that are flat on the year. Good short term play. A long term weed play I like is IIPR.","I stand by the fact this discussion is important, but this post is 24 hours before polls open.

- (short term buy) DJT. Thesis is straightforward. Trump wins, the stock is a direct way to give the president money. Long term I wouldn’t hold due to serious uncertainty and the odds he sells out his stock. 
- I’m selling individual stocks that may be overexposed to incoming tariffs (like Apple). (Note, I would be buying index funds that contain these stocks. I still believe in the stock but want to avoid heavy individual exposure. ) 
- I already established a Gold position. I think that’s a good short-mid term hedge against a Trump win. 
- Per the speaker of the house comments, the Chips act is at risk if Trump wins. I’d invest in chip exposure abroad (already have ASML and would build there). 

For a Kamala win:
- continue buying my current portfolio. Status quo remains the same so no big change needed. Less urge to sell individual plays. 
- weed legalization is on the table, there are a number of weed stocks that are flat on the year. Good short term play. A long term weed play I like is IIPR.",1,,,,reddit

- Both candidates prompt varying differences in non-index fund investments.

For a Kamala win you may want exposure to weed stocks given her pro-legalization stance.

Red Metal Resources Expands Land Position in Natural Hydrogen District, Quebec

November 05, 2024 3:01 AM EST | Source: Red Metal Resources Ltd.

Vancouver, British Columbia--(November 5, 2024) - RED METAL RESOURCES LTD. (CSE: RMES) (OTC PINK: RMESF) (FSE: I660) (""Red Metal"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce it has acquired a 100% interest in four additional mineral claims directly contiguous to Quebec Innovative Materials Corp.'s (""QIMC"") recent expansion claims staking and in the area of its expansion of its natural renewable hydrogen discovery (See QIMC news dated October 3rd 2024).

The Company's four new claims are located to the North of QIMC's announced 11 km expansion of natural renewable hydrogen discovery. Recent soil gas measurements from QIMC's Line 13 recorded at 594, 543, and 463 ppm, are the highest levels detected outside of those previously reported from Line 7 on September 4th, 2024, press release. These new high readings by QIMC, located 11 km northwest of the 1,000 ppm samples collected on Line 7, highlight the district hydrogen-rich zone across the Ville Marie property.

This news release contains information about adjacent properties on which the Company has no right to explore or mine. Investors are cautioned that mineral deposits on adjacent properties are not indicative of mineral deposits on the Company's. 

Fig 1. Location of new RMES claims

Red Metal has now acquired 100% interest in four separate packages of mineral claims and mineral claim applications and is currently reviewing regional geological data to assist in the evaluation of potential additional acquisitions in the immediate area as well as the formulation of an initial exploration plan with further details to be provided in due course.

Red Metal Resources President and CEO, Caitlin Jeffs, stated, ""We are aggressively expanding our geological footprint in this emerging natural hydrogen district and are actively evaluating additional acquisitions in the area. Recent natural hydrogen discoveries demonstrate the rich potential and uniqueness of this region and strategically positions Red Metal amongst first movers of sustainable energy solutions through renewable natural hydrogen. Red Metal is actively planning an initial exploration program directly next to QIMC's recent hydrogen discovery. This new property represents an exciting opportunity to expand our clean energy portfolio as we continue to advance our Carrizal Copper/Gold/Cobalt property in the Coastal Cordillera, Chile.""

Red Metal's claim blocks now consist of four separate packages, covering 23 cells and totaling over 1,300 hectares to the North, Northeast and the Southwest of QIMC's Hydrogen-in-soil sample discovery. These claim blocks are contiguous on three sides to Quebec Innovative Materials Corp. and cover possible extensions in multiple directions. To date, 15 of the 23 cells have been approved by the Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests.

Terms of the Agreement

Under the terms of the Agreement to acquire a 100% interest in four mineral claims, Company has agreed to pay CA$5,000. No royalty is to be paid out of any potential future revenue. The Company's acquisition of the Property remains subject to customary conditions of closing, including the approval of the Canadian Securities Exchange (if required).

About Red Metal Resources Ltd.

Red Metal Resources is a mineral exploration company focused on growth through acquiring, exploring and developing clean energy and strategic minerals projects. The Company's current portfolio include the 100% owned Ville Marie claims in Quebec, Canada as well as Company's Chilean projects which are located in the prolific Candelaria iron oxide copper-gold (IOCG) belt of Chile's coastal Cordillera.

Hey everyone, I recently inherited around €170,000 and, for the last four months, I've been diving into the world of investing to make sure I put it to good use. I’ve read up on different strategies and watched tutorials, but I know there’s only so much you can learn from reading. So, I’m here to ask for some advice from those of you who have more experience in the field – I’d really appreciate any feedback on my plan to make sure I'm not overlooking anything important.

# Here’s My Investment Plan:

* 60-70% in ETFs and Index Funds: I’m leaning heavily towards diversified ETFs and index funds, thinking this will be a solid foundation that balances growth with manageable risk. I’m willing to be patient and hold these for the long term. I like the idea of regular, predictable returns without the added stress of picking individual stocks.
* 30-40% in Gold and Real Estate: To diversify further, I want to allocate a chunk of the remaining funds to gold (either a gold ETF or physical gold) and maybe explore real estate. My thinking here is to create some stability and hedge against inflation.

# My Questions:

1. Is it reasonable to put this much money into Index Funds, given that I’m new to investing? I see a lot of recommendations to do so to grow wealth and protect it from inflation, but this is a huge amount of money to me, and I’m nervous about putting it all into something I just started learning about. Does investing in ETFs and index funds sound reasonable for someone in my situation? I’m looking for long-term growth with a relatively moderate risk level.
2. Considering the global situation and high inflation, are my choices still suitable? With inflation, geopolitical tensions, and more conservative economic policies, does this approach to investing seem appropriate, or should I consider different strategies to protect this money?
3. Would a robo-advisor be useful in my case, or is sticking with ETFs and index funds enough? Since I’m not super comfortable with direct stock picking, I’m hoping ETFs and index funds will cover me well. I’m also curious if robo-advisors add enough value to justify their fees in this situation, or if they’re better suited for people who want a “set it and forget it” approach.
4. Any other tips or advice for someone in my position? Especially when it comes to balancing growth with safety, avoiding beginner mistakes, or picking funds wisely. I’d love to hear what’s worked (or hasn’t worked!) for you.

Thanks in advance!","# Inherited Cash – Planning to Invest and Seeking Advice from Experienced Investors

I experienced three stock market/recessions crashes in my early 20’s and my late 20’s with the housing bubble, then COVID happened and here we all go again down the rabbit hole. 

Today, I am more intuitive to the economic changes and knowledgeable than 2001, 2008, and 2020. 

I invested my disposable income money instead of wasteful spending.

Thoughts??","I experienced three stock market/recessions crashes in my early 20’s and my late 20’s with the housing bubble, then COVID happened and here we all go again down the rabbit hole. 

Today, I am more intuitive to the economic changes and knowledgeable than 2001, 2008, and 2020. 

I invested my disposable income money instead of wasteful spending.

So, will there be any new car model for Tesla in 2025???

**Musk now says it's 'pointless' to build a $25,000 Tesla for human drivers**  
[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-now-says-its-pointless-build-25000-tesla-human-drivers-2024-11-05](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-now-says-its-pointless-build-25000-tesla-human-drivers-2024-11-05)

&#x200B;

*When Reuters reported in April that Tesla had scrapped plans for a long-promised, next-generation $25,000 electric vehicle, the automaker’s stock plunged. Chief Executive Elon Musk rushed to respond on X, his social-media network.*  
*“Reuters is lying,” he posted, without elaborating. Tesla’s stock recovered some of its losses.*  
*Six months later, Musk appears to have backed into an admission that Tesla dropped its plans for a human-driven $25,000 car. He said in an Oct. 23 earnings call that building the affordable EV would be ""pointless” unless the car was fully autonomous.*  
*His latest remarks came in response to an investor asking: “When can we expect Tesla to give us the $25,000 non-robotaxi regular car model?”*  
*Musk responded: “We’re not making a non-robo…,” before he was interrupted by another Tesla executive. Musk later added: “Basically, I think having a regular $25K model is pointless. It would be silly.”*  
*The April 5 Reuters article reported that Tesla had abandoned plans for an all-new, affordable mass-market EV but still planned a self-driving robotaxi. Since then, Musk has increasingly touted plans for robotaxis and autonomous vehicles.*  
*Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this story.*  
*On the October earnings call, Musk said that Tesla does plan a “$25K car” – its “Cybercab,” a two-door, two-seat, fully autonomous vehicle. Musk unveiled a prototype at a Hollywood-style event on Oct. 10.*  
*Musk says Tesla will start production of the Cybercab in 2026, after it deploys fully autonomous versions of its current Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Texas and California next year. The automaker faces steep technological, regulatory and legal challenges in delivering on Musk’s latest promises of fully autonomous vehicles, which echo others dating back about a decade.*  
*An all-new affordable Tesla for human drivers had until recently been a linchpin of Tesla’s strategy to become the world’s biggest automaker. For several years, Tesla had a goal of producing 20 million vehicles a year by 2030, more than tenfold what it sells now and nearly double that of Toyota, the current global sales leader. In May, Tesla dropped the 20-million goal from its latest “impact report” on progress toward sustainability goals.*  
*As recently as January of this year, Musk confirmed the plan for an all-new affordable EV in an earnings call. He said the next-generation vehicle would arrive in 2025 and launch a second major ""growth wave,” following the first wave with the release of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in 2017 and 2020, respectively.*  
*Investors and Tesla fans commonly called the anticipated cheap car a “Model 2,” slotting in below the Model 3, currently the least-expensive Tesla, starting at $42,490.*  
*In January, Musk described the all-new model as requiring “new revolutionary manufacturing technology.” But in April, after Reuters reported Tesla had scrapped the Model 2, Musk outlined a plan for “more affordable” models that could be produced “on the same manufacturing lines” as current Teslas.*  
*Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar Research Services analyst, said he believes these less-expensive vehicles will be built on current Tesla platforms and priced in the mid-$30,000s.*  
*“It was my understanding that the original plan was to make the more-affordable vehicle on a new platform,” he told Reuters. “I think Tesla realized they were late to making an affordable vehicle versus their Chinese-EV peers … So, they changed their strategy rather than make a large investment to produce a new vehicle.”*  
*After the April 5 Reuters report that Tesla had killed the Model 2, Musk posted that day on X saying Tesla planned a “robotaxi unveil” in August. The event, delayed until October and held on a movie set near Los Angeles, underwhelmed Wall Street and drove a 9% drop in Tesla shares the following day.*  
*Some investors viewed Musk’s comments on the Cybercab – along with displays of an autonomous “Robovan” concept and humanoid robots – as short on concrete details about the products. Tesla hasn’t said whether the Cybercab will feature new self-driving technology beyond the company’s “Full Self-Driving” feature in its current vehicles. Its existing models can’t fully drive themselves and require a human driver paying strict attention.*  
*The target market for the Cybercab isn’t clear. The Cybercab’s sports-car looks and two-door, two-seat configuration – a nearly extinct layout in the wider U.S. auto market – puzzled some analysts who expected a robotaxi with more room for passengers and luggage.*  
*Musk, in the October earnings call, said the concept vehicle’s design was “optimized for autonomy” and would also deliver affordability.*  
*“It will cost … roughly 25K, so it is a 25K car,” Musk said. “It just won't have a steering wheel and pedals.”*","So, will there be any new car model for Tesla in 2025???

Trump trade strategy: Put Gold + Put Silver + Call USD + Call crude oil —> Horizon call 3 month OTM

Harris trade strategy: Call Gold + Call Silver + Put USD + Put crude oil --> Horizon call 3 month OTM

I found sharing an idea and opinions interesting during this uncertain context.

I don't agree with this table and this is my opinion:

If Mr Trump is elected, I see a good reaction from the stock market (especially in the US) thanks to his support for the ""US first"" mentality.

Furthermore, He will create big barriers (tariffs) against Chinese products and companies that could be ""profitable"" for the US stock market.

Regarding the commodities and FX market (USD), the confidence in Trump's economic plan thanks to his previous mandate and his current campaign, the DXY (USD) index will strengthen his position.

As a result of the reinforcement of the DXY and negative correlation, we'll see weaknesses in precious metals (XAUUSD & XAGUSD).

Also, If Trump is elected, we obviously will see a strong crypto Bullmarket 

Finally, If Madam Harris is elected, her economic plan could strengthen the position of the United States in international trade (with China) and, therefore, perhaps weaken the USD against the rising power of the BRICS.

I remember buying degen FDs on AMD puts and AAPL puts on Oct 2018 and made several thousand in a blink of an eye. The entire stock market was wild af. You have idiots on this sub making a dumb amount of money by random luck, only to lose it all then next day.

According to my inverse DCF model, the stock price would have to rise up to 0.80 for future EPS expectations to match 2024's current EPS. That's just for short-term congruence. The assumed ROA is 17.2%, 11x lower than the current ROA of 198.4% and 34.5x lower than 2025 projections of 595%.

2024-11-06,GLD,investing,post,1gl69j8,,,Trump win Bullish or Bearish for GOLD?,"Trump win Bullish or Bearish for GOLD?
Gold has had a pretty good rally up until recently. You think it'll keep going up and break ATH now that Trump won or will the pattern reverse?

Trump’s previous term did see significant fluctuations in gold prices, influenced by both his policies and larger market trends. Some analysts argue that Trump’s stance on fiscal policy, especially around trade and spending, could create an environment where gold thrives. If somehow there’s renewed uncertainty or if inflation concerns rise, gold could benefit from that risk-averse sentiment.

On the other hand, if he sticks to his word and stops the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, then the new ""peaceful climate"" could cause gold prices to drop, as gold is seen as a safe haven asset that people flock to during economic and geopolitical turmoil.

On the flip side, it’s worth noting that the recent rally has been strong, and some traders are starting to worry about whether the price is sustainable. A correction wouldn’t be unusual, especially if markets start factoring in potential stability or if there’s a push toward riskier assets. Additionally, interest rates can play a huge role in gold prices. If there’s a shift toward higher rates, we might see downward pressure on gold as investors turn to interest-bearing assets.

At this point, it feels like a coin toss. The key factors to watch will be any policy announcements from Trump, how markets react in the coming months, and of course, global economic conditions. 

What do you guys think? Is gold ready to hit a new ATH, or are we in for a pullback?","Gold has had a pretty good rally up until recently. You think it'll keep going up and break ATH now that Trump won or will the pattern reverse?

I have been timing the market for over 10 years. Elsewhere and earlier I predicted gold per ounce would go down, my thesis was that miners (GOLD:Barrick and NEM:Newmont) usually front run gold price. There can be multiple factors in figuring the price of a miner, oil and copper are usually the big externalities.

Copper price will make a mine more profitable, usually.  
Oil will add to cost.

I assessed a couple weeks ago that it was unlikely that oil cost would become excessive, having been much higher in the last year when gold was a lower price, and that copper is in a lull. I'm bullish both copper and oil.

Thus I concluded that gold miners were front running the gold price.

My target was the 20 weekly; we are only at the 50daily. But I think we will hit the 20 weekly in which case I'll start to buy gold miners or I'll buy gold outright.

  
Gold makes up about 68% of my portfolio; so I've been selling covered calls on GLD to finance holding the asset which is considered to have a ""negative yield"". I generate about 3% dividend yearly from this strategy buy-hold.

So Gold has historically been my ""buy forever"" from selling profits elsewhere. I think after this run though we will see a 10+ year gold bear market. This is due to the ""behavior of money"". Money behaves a certain way in money markets. Gold will top out somewhere near $4,000 est. and then it'll enter a long bear market. Gold has done this 3 times before since the early 1970s. So there's no reason to think it's not a mechanical reality in a delicate balance of interest rate parities, currency availability and liquidity globally.","I have been timing the market for over 10 years.

For a Trump win,

•	⁠congrats to anyone with a DJT position
•	⁠I’m selling individual stocks that may be overexposed to incoming tariffs (like Apple).
•	⁠I already established a Gold position. I think that’s a good short-long term hedge against a Trump. If you think economists are correct inflation will rebound and gdp will decrease then gold is a portfolio saver. 
•	⁠Per the speaker of the house comments, the Chips act is at risk. I’d invest in chip related exposure abroad (already have ASML and would add to this).

New thoughts
- I’m unfortunately worried about the long term picture of Europe. The US was keeping Ukraine in the war. Ukraine controls a significant amount of crop production in Europe which will eventually fall under Russian control.

[I posted here many moons ago (25 days ago) that Archer Aviation was on the precipice of something huge](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g2w8rw/part_3_archer_aviation_is_going_to_pick_up_major/) in Advanced Air Mobility Aircraft aka eVTOL aka AIR Taxis aka flying cars aka the Jetsons.

Today, [I have delivered on that prediction](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/jal-sumitomo-jv-secures-right-place-order-up-100-archer-air-taxis-2024-11-07/) and today Japanese Airlines Partnership with Sumitomo Group Joint Venture Soracle have agreed to purchase 100 Archer Midnight Aircraft.

This deal is a testament to the continued leadership of Adam Goldstein and the Archer Team.

But I have something more important to discuss with you today and it deals with American Air Dominance which I am referring to AADAAM (American Air Dominance Advanced Air Mobility) aka ADAM aka ADAM Flying Cars. We cannot let China do what they are doing to the EV market with dumping a bunch of unsafe and impractical flying vehicles that aren't conformed through the rigorous FAA rules and regulations.

China will try to steal our technology and our advancements by any means necessary. We cannot let that happen. If you're wondering what the hell I am talking about look no further than this headline:

# China accelerates its plan to develop a USD44 billion low altitude economy by 2026

In this article, The China Communist Party is willing to go to any means necessary to win on the EV Flying Cars low altitude economy by running not only a state sponsored dump and dump scheme but also they will employ espionage and sabotage for ADAM Flying Cars.

>The launch today of the Jiangmen Low-Altitude Tourism Town project (including an order for 100 Xpeng Aerhot eVTOLs) and the Taiyuan City low altitude programme in late May (with the purchase of up to 500 EHang EH-216 eVTOLs), marks a new phase of acceleration of the Chinese government’s “low altitude economy” strategy.  
...  
Meanwhile, a *China Daily* report of late May 2024 said that Guangdong province has drafted a 2024-2026 plan to develop a low-altitude hub in the province which will generate revenues exceeding 300 billion yuan (USD41.4 billion). The plan aims to establish a low-altitude eco-system featuring coordinated development between three key cities — Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai. The plan proposes to explore and open low-altitude air routes between Guangdong and Hainan provinces.

Espionage? Too crazy for you on a Thursday morning. Look at this post on the sub u/achr [Evtolstockman is a Chinese eHang Shill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACHR/comments/1glfc9w/evtolstockman_is_a_chinese_ehang_shill/)

https://preview.redd.it/l0zm7nqpxhzd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76b752d64692531ed4c92383905bde23d67dc4b3

It is my belief that not only is that troll, which there are 1000 examples of him doing this, simply promoting Ehang. I also believe that he is part of a Chinese state sponsored disinformation and pro China hype campaign that through China support is also participating in market manipulation through enormous short pressure on the Archer and Joby stock prices.

I have posted daily the amount of Off Exchange Dark Money Pools are hammering Archer stock in particular. This is a daily activity for this market that is unrelenting and purposeful with the intention of driving down the eVTOL AAM market outside of the state sponsored Chinese Espionage activities. Make no mistake, this is through sympathy and through concert of the Grizzly Research report on ACHR released over a year ago.

ACHR is shorted over 60 Million shares and has dragged the effective market cap down to $1 Billion. I am here to tell you that Archer Aviation is WORTH MORE, MUCH MORE, than only $1 Billion.

If the Communist Party of China is willing to pour $44 BIllion USD (Gazillion yuan) into the ""Low Altitude Economy"" by 2026 than what the hell do you think Archer Aviation is worth? Surely it cannot only be worth $1 Billion.

Today Archer Aviation will have its Earnings Call After Hours and I look forward to hearing from Adam Goldstein and the Archer team on a fantastic quarter and future quarter guidance of the Type Certification, UAE operations in 2025/2026 and Piloted Flight for the Midnight Aircraft. The call is going to be awesome!

Here is what we must hear on the call with clarity and conviction

* When piloted flight
* When UAE operations
* When Type Certification completion and corresponding progress q by q
* When more money come from prior commitments
* When moon

I have a ton of ACHR shares and will look for qualitative news like today's and the continued leadership by Adam Goldstein to add more when appropriate.

The average realized price of gold sold was $3,420 (US$2,508) per ounce. 
* Net income increased to $39.0 million, or $0.26 earnings per share, an increase of $42.2 million from the corresponding quarter in 2023 and $9.9 million, or $0.07 earnings per share, from Q2 2024.
* EBITDA increased to $84.6 million or by more than 6.5 times relative to the prior year quarter mainly due to an increase in ounces sold, a higher average realized price of gold sold and lower cash costs. 
* Net cash flow from operating activities increased to $61.0 million, or $0.41 operating cash flow per share, $15.9 million higher than the prior year's quarter mainly due to a higher average realized price of gold sold. 
* Free cash flow increased to $30.8 million, or $0.21 per share, compared to $10.7 million, or $0.07 per share, in the corresponding period in 2023 mainly due to higher average realized price of gold sold. It was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures.

* Consolidated 2024 production guidance range has been narrowed to between 166,000 and 176,000 ounces of gold, while increasing cash costs per ounce sold to $1,225 to $1,300 and AISC per ounce sold to $1,975 to $2,100 (US$1,445 to US$1,525).

B. If you think Trump will cause hyperinflation, you go take a bunch of loans out buy up a fuck load of hard assets and pay them all off as our currency implodes. Don’t recommend this route, I think we have inflation incoming but doubt we’d hit hyperinflation (this line might haunt me in the future LOL) 

Quality/value stocks are risky when it comes to tariff based inflation. You have to seriously understand a companies supply chain to avoid getting hurt. It’s a big problem considering China and Mexico are 2 of our top 3 trade partners.","A. If you want to hedge inflation regardless of level of degree: Gold and other valuable resources.

Update about your 0.5% APY boost

Hi ****,

On November 7, the Federal Reserve reduced the Federal Funds Target Rate by 0.25%, which results in a drop in interest rates throughout the financial services industry. While we make necessary changes to the cash sweep program, your 0.5% APY boost is temporarily paused. You will still earn the full 60 days of your 0.5% APY boost. We’ll let you know when your boost resumes (likely within 30 days).

Although interest rates will be lowered across the industry, we can confirm you're still receiving 4.5% APY on uninvested cash with Robinhood—one of the highest rates on cash in the industry. As a Robinhood Gold member, you’re also still earning a 1% unlimited deposit boost.

I’m more of the mind that abandoning regulation will favor goliaths and oligopolies who will abuse their scale to stifle competition.  But as you indicate, I don’t really worry about that impacting BIPC too significantly.


> I think solar would have to prove it's economically sustainable without preferential grid treatment or tax credits

I’m satisfied it’s economically viable and know that it’s just a matter of time for opponents to catch up.  Solar is free unlimited electricity from the sun.  It’s most abundant where it’s most needed.  At the same time, electricity is expensive and is in sharply, permanently rising demand.  No matter what oil prices have done, I bet nobody here has seen their electric rates gone down.  
 
Solar is like a device that generates something valuable and requires $0 input cost.  It’s like a wheel that spins air into gold or a car that doesn’t need fuel.  The only issue then becomes “how much should someone pay for such a device?”  Considering it generates something of value for free, even a high price tag is tempting.  And that price drops every day.

The opponents use deflection “it doesn’t work at night”.  Who cares?  Would you refuse a gold-producing widget because it only worked half the time?  And with storage options being more prevalent (and necessary, given our blown out grid) that just helps the business case of solar.

I’m confident that solar has a bright future even with lesser preferential grid policy or tax credits.  Whether 5 year payback becomes 8 or 10 year payback, there’s still a guaranteed payback.","> If you buy the popular narrative Trump will ease regulations on the financial sector, alternate asset managers would thrive under him.

2024-11-09,GLD,wallstreetbets,comment,1gmxc3z,lw8id7h,t1_lw7m2se,,"Newton's error was fixed in 100 yrs. Gold standard had become the convention by then. But even after the next recoinage and increased availability of silver, gold standard remained. 

This is because as Adam Smith had observed in 1776 itself, there wasn't enough coinage to fuel global trade regardless of the metal. Bank money like Amsterdam (just entries of credit and debit at a commercial bank rather than actual money changing hands) was driving European trade, and paper currency was already facilitating domestic trade and government debt (especiallyin American colonies). Obsession with metal coinage was a relic of mercantilism (though the rest of the world only caught up to this idea centuries later).

So, the complete abandonment of gold standard had less to do with availability of metal and more to do with increased understanding of banking and trade globally, in my opinion. In any timeline where Bretton Woods or a similar event happened, gold/ silver standard was going to be abandoned as long as the currency adopted for global trade (dollar) remained dominant.","Newton's error was fixed in 100 yrs. Gold standard had become the convention by then. But even after the next recoinage and increased availability of silver, gold standard remained. 

This is because as Adam Smith had observed in 1776 itself, there wasn't enough coinage to fuel global trade regardless of the metal. Bank money like Amsterdam (just entries of credit and debit at a commercial bank rather than actual money changing hands) was driving European trade, and paper currency was already facilitating domestic trade and government debt (especiallyin American colonies). Obsession with metal coinage was a relic of mercantilism (though the rest of the world only caught up to this idea centuries later).

For the cash portion (around 50-66%), a high-yield savings account or money market fund could work well. These accounts offer easy access to your funds with a modest return, helping offset inflation slightly without risking principal.

For the inflation-protected portion, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are worth considering. TIPS are backed by the U.S. government, offer inflation protection, and adjust their value based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). You can buy TIPS directly from the Treasury or through a TIPS-focused ETF for liquidity and diversification.

Since you already own Sprott Gold and Silver Trust, which is quite volatile, you might add some stable, inflation-resistant assets to balance it out. Consider adding exposure to commodities, real estate (through a REIT ETF), or even short-term bond funds focused on inflation-protected or floating-rate bonds. These can offer some inflation protection without the volatility that gold and silver sometimes bring.

This mix of cash, TIPS, and select inflation-resistant assets should provide you with both stability and some growth potential, preserving your purchasing power over the two years without excessive risk.","To set up a two-year reserve fund with both cash stability and inflation protection, consider a mix of assets that balance safety, liquidity, and inflation resilience.

I stopped at “I have answers” however, looking forward to picking it back up. A personal hope is to see “off grid” sites giving back to the grid (for zero costs). Most off grid is solar (non-sustainable after 25-30 years) of which we are hitting a benchmark, since it first became available in the 90s at reasonable costs. 

Smelting of the glass panels will be a delicate process (and VERY lucrative). Since most “micro” gold is easily re-cyclable. Traditional smelting works decently, modern science (however) is working towards the remediation, inoculation, and gold purification VIA fungal purification methods (NO JOKES!). And it is reportedly 80% (?) more effective than crucibles and high heat.

Another “off grid” means of power is water turbines and ram-auger systems. There are quite a few designs (most notably patented in JAPAN) that have little-to-no interruptions of natural water flow, and do not impede or injure the fish. For all the mountain BEARS out there, this bit of natural Green Peace knowledge is worth its weight in, you guessed it, GOLD.

These are both very sound examples of “low impact” energy that, when returned to the GRID (by way of a “mighty mid-shipman” or “messenger” — the most valuable pal — of supply chain regulation) will ASTRONOMICALLY lower the cost of utilities for anyone unable or simple content at (status) pro quo. 

Are you seeing the big picture?

Nicola Tesla was sought out and then HIDDEN by the pervading forces for a reason. The ability to create energy “en perpetuity” is the most dangerous to the “ruling class.” However, Mother Nature has already, implicitly, told us : 

“Hey! It’s okay. Just play nice.”

Gentlemen, I have come across some intelligence that may just be more than some regarded plan to retire early on a beach in Tahiti. I also might be high as fuck.


I was watching a streamer reacting to videos put out by Trump. Like any respectable american would, I wanted to verify the source material with my own research. I go to twitter, as one does when looking for the latest news about Donald Trump, only to discover a desolate wasteland where snarky quips and comedy gold used to live. Upon further research, I discover he only posts those videos on Truth Social. And, herein lies my thesis. I'm not sure when Trump officially switched, and I generally consider myself to be in the know. But if I had no idea, most of the public probably has not a clue. But now, he is in the Whitehouse again. And when people start looking for the latest news from Trump, they will find Truth Social... I just made an account.

Now, DJT is set to post earnings right at the inauguration. They have yet to post positive earnings, but the latest figures were looking good. I bet the Q1 2025 reports shatters our current expectations. I'm going balls deep in this one.

2024-11-10,GLD,wallstreetbets,post,1go9qx3,,,Nokia (NOK) DD: The Ultimate Boomer Phone Renaissance Play 🚀,"Nokia (NOK) DD: The Ultimate Boomer Phone Renaissance Play 🚀
🦧 Listen up, smooth-brained brothers. While you're all busy YOLOing into whatever Cathie Wood sneezed on this morning, I've been doing some actual research (yes, reading makes my head hurt too) into the most based value play of the decade: Nokia.

# The TL;DR for you crayon eaters:

* Smart phones are making us dumber than a bag of rocks
* Gen Z is getting based and flipphone-pilled
* Nokia's building 5G infrastructure like crazy
* This isn't financial advice, I use glue in my cereal every morning.

# The Science Behind Your Brain Rot 🧠

You think I'm just another boomer yelling at clouds? Think again. A 2017 study published in the Journal of the Association for Consumer Research literally called ""Brain Drain: The Mere Presence of One's Own Smartphone Reduces Available Cognitive Capacity"" showed that just having your smartphone nearby makes you dumber than buying WISH at $15.

More research from Univercity of London found that excessive smartphone use correlates with lower analytical thinking capabilities. Translation: phones = smooth brain.

# The Great Phone Rebellion 📱

Here's where it gets juicy. The zoomers, in their infinite wisdom, are starting to rebel:

* ""Digital minimalism"" trending on TikTok (ironic, I know)
* Flip phone sales up 27% in 2023
* ""Dumb phone"" searches on Amazon increased 89% YoY

# Nokia's God-Tier Position 💪

While you apes were distracted by iPhone 15 Pro Max Ultra Whatever, Nokia's been:

1. Dominating the basic phone market (still indestructible)
2. Building massive 5G infrastructure (300+ commercial deals)
3. Sitting on a treasure trove of patents
4. Trading at a P/E lower than my IQ

# The Numbers (For Nerds Who Can Read) 📊

* Current Price: \~$3.50
* Market Cap: \~$19B
* Revenue: $24.9B (2023)
* Cash on hand: $4.9B
* Debt: Manageable AF

# Risk Assessment (Because My Lawyer Said So)

* 5G competition from Huawei and Ericsson
* Potential semiconductor shortages
* The possibility I'm actually regarded

# Position or Ban

* 2000 shares @ $3.48
* Jan 2025 $5 Calls (because I like pain)

# Conclusion 🚀

Nokia isn't just your dad's favorite phone company anymore. They're positioned to capitalize on both the smartphone rebellion and the 5G revolution. While everyone else is fighting over who can make the shiniest pocket computer, Nokia's building the infrastructure that makes it all work AND offering an escape route from smartphone addiction.

I'll see you all on the moon, or behind the Wendy's dumpster.

","Archer Aviation (ACHR) 🚀🚀 🚀🚀 (Kitty also playing this stock)


Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF.

In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis.

First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a \~19% and \~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively.

Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”.

Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written.

[Grizzly's article you can read for yourself](https://grizzlyreports.com/we-believe-archer-aviation-inc-nasdaqachr-is-a-lame-duck/) but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023):

1. **Misleading DoD contract:**
   * **Claim**: Archer’s **DoD contract** was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a **noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract**, with only **$1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023**, far less significant than portrayed.
   * **Reference**: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023.""
2. **Flight Activity Misrepresentation:**
   * **Claim**: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a **handful of flights**, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress.
   * **Reference**: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights.""
3. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants:**
   * **Claim**: Archer’s partnerships with **United Airlines** and **Stellantis** were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant.
   * **Reference**: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation.""
4. **FAA Certification Timeline:**
   * **Claim**: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive **Type Certification** for its Midnight aircraft until at least **2028**, not 2024 as Archer claimed.
   * **Reference**: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate.""
5. **Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing:**
   * **Claim**: Archer settled a legal dispute with **Wisk/Boeing** by giving **$100 million in free shares** to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims.
   * **Reference**: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing.""
6. **Incomplete Manufacturing Facility:**
   * **Claim**: Archer promised its **San Jose lab and small-scale production facility** would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines.
   * **Reference**: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023.""
7. **Stock Dilution and Early Vesting:**
   * **Claim**: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing **free shares to partners** like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense.
   * **Reference**: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early.""

All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it.","Archer Aviation is worth believing in.

2024-11-11,GLD,wallstreetbets,post,1gosmbl,,,The end of a historic week! This week's top market concerns US CPI,"The end of a historic week! This week's top market concerns US CPI
With the dust settling from the election and the Fed's November rate cut, the market focus is quickly shifting to the heavy inflation data coming out this week, particularly the U.S. Consumer Price Index ( CPI ).

On Wednesday, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics will release October CPI data. The market is widely expected:
CPI rose 2.6% year-on-year in October, up 0.2 percentage points from the previous month's 2.4%, and was unchanged from the previous month at 0.2% YoY;
CoreCPIyear-over-year and year-over-year gains were unchanged at 3.3% and 0.3%, respectively.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the U.S. CPI and core CPI are expected to have risen 0.2% and 0.3% from a year earlier in October, but the increase is not expected to have a significant impact on interest rates.

The agency's analysts Ohsung Kwon and others said in a report published last week that despite accelerating upward pressure on prices during the economic recovery, this will not lead to significant changes in inflation expectations or threaten the Fed's inflation target.
Slowing down the rate cut bets enhanced last week's Fed FOMC meeting after the rate cut of 25 basis points as expected by the market. Powell said in the post-meeting press conference, the fight against inflation is not yet over, core inflation is still to some extent high, the job market continues to cool very slowly, the Fed will continue to cut interest rates, but if inflation cooling stagnant and the economy is strong, can be slower to cut interest rates. In the short term, the U.S. election has no impact on monetary policy, the future impact of fiscal policy will be taken into account, the U.S. deficit and fiscal policy is an economic headwind.

Although the Fed has not hinted at the next pause in action, but because Wall Street bets on slowing down interest rate cuts seem to be quietly warming up. Goldman Sachs now expects the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points each at its meetings in December, January and March next year, and then by 25 basis points in June and September next year, respectively. The previous Goldman Sachs forecast was for a 25 basis point cut in each of May and June.
The CME tool currently shows a 65% chance of a Fed rate cut in December and a 23.6% chance of a continued rate cut next January.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch pointed out that despite the election results have been “nailed on”, but the policy uncertainty is still high. The Federal Reserve in November interest rate meeting on schedule to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, its communication indicates that a rate cut in December is possible. This suggests the Fed may be wary of current economic conditions and ready to take further easing to support growth.

Do not fight the market trend, especially short-term Bank of America Merrill Lynch also emphasized that do not fight the market trend, especially the short-term upward momentum after the U.S. election.

The report notes that post-election momentum usually lasts into the following weeks. When the stock market realizes higher gains on the first day after an election, taking a page from history, in past election cycles, the stock market has been positive 100% of the time for the next two weeks. Interest rates are also largely back to pre-election levels, easing the most significant concerns for stocks, at least for now.

After this election cycle, the S&P 500 gained 2.5% on the first day after the results, its best performance since 1928.","With the dust settling from the election and the Fed's November rate cut, the market focus is quickly shifting to the heavy inflation data coming out this week, particularly the U.S. Consumer Price Index ( CPI ).

On Wednesday, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics will release October CPI data. The market is widely expected:
CPI rose 2.6% year-on-year in October, up 0.2 percentage points from the previous month's 2.4%, and was unchanged from the previous month at 0.2% YoY;
CoreCPIyear-over-year and year-over-year gains were unchanged at 3.3% and 0.3%, respectively.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the U.S. CPI and core CPI are expected to have risen 0.2% and 0.3% from a year earlier in October, but the increase is not expected to have a significant impact on interest rates.

Additionally, is there any other benefit to Robinhood gold besides this match? FWIW I don't plan to do that IRA bonus match.

2024-11-11,GLD,investing,comment,1gojjgt,lwjox6b,t1_lwjnc6a,,"The Robinhood 3% IRA match can is misleading due to restrictive terms. To keep the match, you must maintain a $5 month gold membership for a year and hold matched funds in your IRA for five years, which locks you into fees that can outweigh the match, especially for smaller contributions. Did you even read the terms and conditions or you just think it was free money? 

Unlike typical employer matches, this “benefit” may end up costing more than it’s worth for some users, limiting its value and accessibility. Also, there are a lot of products not available on Robinhood and a majority of users are gamblers. Not set it and forget it investors. The majority of Robinhood users do not keep more than $5k in their accounts. Myself included. Any reasonable investor looking for a set it and forget it (buy and hold) style of investing would use a real brokerage like r/fidelityinvestments, r/schwab, or Vanguard. 

Specifically, tax-loss harvesting involves selling investments at a loss to offset capital gains, reducing taxable income. Investors then reinvest in similar assets, maintaining portfolio value while lowering their tax bill. r/Wealthfront does this for the same or less of a fee than Robinhood charges whilst still giving you all of the same features.  

Robinhood lacks tax-efficient selling options, forcing FIFO as the default, which can increase taxes by selling oldest shares first. Without choices like LIFO or Specific Identification to reduce tax impact, Robinhood limits control over tax strategy—making it a poor choice for optimizing investment gains. And that is an option EVERY investor uses.","The Robinhood 3% IRA match can is misleading due to restrictive terms.

Most people in here don’t seem to be taking into consideration the tax penalties associated with an early withdrawal on a 401k (assuming you’re under the age where you aren’t subject to penalties and tax if you withdraw it). Any outright withdraw before the age of 62 or 63 gets taxed and penalized 10%, so you’d lose like 30% minimum to Uncle Sam if you do that…However, if it’s a 401k you can take a loan on, you’re ok with the payments this would require, and you’re totally convinced it’s going to hell in a hand-basket, you could theoretically protect up to half of it by taking a loan, parking the money in high interest savings or some other relatively safe/insulated financial vehicle that offers a favorable ROI (gold, CD, bonds, take your pick, or a riskier one if you’re not that risk averse) to ride it out. Meanwhile you’d be paying the loan back to yourself plus like 10% interest (interest would, or should, also go back to you), and there’d be no tax penalties.

I want to say that at least everyone agrees in the fundamental concept but there is even a vocal minority of people who think investing in general is wrong and you should be holding literal gold bars. 

I don't agree with that, but I'm saying this because you have to **be prepared to do your own homework and be always aware that the advice you get may be wrong or even an outright lie.**

There is a long list of media sites that are outright banned here and that is not without reason https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index

To start, you should read the FAQ and the Getting Started with investing link (https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/faq) (https://www.nasdaq.com/education/stocks-rule%3A-what-they-are-and-how-they-make-money)

From there, personally I reccommend looking into the /r/bogleheads approach to investing. It is only one of many, many, many contradictory ways to invest, but it is the one that I think most clearly understands that **investing is not a game, it is your own future survival** takes that implication seriously. 

Especially beware anyone who is getting paid to give you advice or selling you their advice.  They are earning money by selling advice...which implies they are **not** earning money from investing...which they could easily do if their own advice worked. Advice easily available for sale is actually an indication that the advice does not work. So be very wary of anyone selling you things in this world and do your own homework.","Let my first advice to you be one of caution:  Investing is a world of contradictions and straight up con artists.

I would wait until actual policies are implemented (not announced because repeal/replace ACA, building the wall, and balancing the budget were all cornerstones of Trump 1. Trump 2 will definitely include tax cuts. All Republican trifeta's in gov't feature tax cuts.

Only a fool would bet money on what Trump says he would do on a complex issue or one that doesn't directly benefit him. 

Most likely, it was a way for him to float the tax cuts will be offset by tariffs nonsense. If he does implement tariffs, prices will go up. Inflationary environment winners will do well, things like gold will do well, but that's a huge IF. Another thing to consider is retaliation.

„Macros + Strategy R VT“  
„HSBC Trinkaus Aphascreen“

Pros:
-DAU growth surging. Google realizes their search sucks and is sending droves of people to Reddit. 

-Ad revenue growing strongly. They are finally figuring out how to monetize the site after 2 decades.

-Subreddits have very specific niches and are pure gold to advertisers. Want to advertise to NJ moms that enjoy eating grilled lobsters while wearing fluorescent green thongs? There’s probably a subreddit with 20,000 members floating around.

-Licensing reams of data to LLM/AI companies. This can be thought of a very high margin annuity as data can go stale and needs to keep pouring in.

-AI is efficiently translating all the English content to other languages, which will cause an explosion of growth internationally.  

-Low hosting and operating costs as mainly text-based. 

-User generated content means not spending billions on creating content like $nflx.

-CFO is solid and actually gives a shit about GAAP numbers and not adjusted EBIDTA BS.

-SBC is something they don’t want to go bonkers on like SNAP. They are very cognizant of dilution. 

-Probably the best place online for brands to connect with customers and to also gauges brand temperature. Very authentic human interactions and discussions due to the huge amount of users and the downvoting system which gets rid of bot replies and pushes good content to the top. 

-Massive moat / barrier to entry. How can it be replicated? Would be extremely difficult and costly.

-Can really start to get a piece of the global advertising pie if they can fix their search function.

Cons
-Google can stop promoting Reddit in search results, which would limit user growth.

-Users that come in from Google aren’t logged in, thus generate less revenue from ads.

Hello, Reddit! I am a 19-year-old who started working full-time at the beginning of this year and decided to focus on improving my finances. I began investing my money in early October and wanted to share my progress with you all. I’d love to hear your opinions and get some constructive criticism.

I’ve learned a lot from reading other posts on this subreddit, and I personally think I’m on the right track. However, I’m eager to gain more knowledge and continue improving.

So far, my current goal is to prioritize maxing out my Roth IRA every year. Once that’s done, I’ll shift my focus to investing in ETFs on Robinhood. In my Roth IRA, I currently have around $6,000, which I’ve allocated as follows: FXAIX - 60%, FSPTX - 20%, FTIHX - 10%, and FXNAX - 10%. I think this split is fairly good, but I’m open to suggestions for improvement.

On Robinhood, I have about $3,500 invested, split between VOO, VTI, and GLD.

I also learned that having an emergency fund is an important step, so I set aside $10,000 in a 12-month flexible CD..

This is my progress so far, and I plan to continue growing my portfolio by investing around $500–$1,000 from my $1,500–$1,700 bi-weekly paycheck.","

**The Great Banana Blunder: A Satirical Tale of Dole's Dilemmas**

Once upon a time in the lush lands of Fruitopia, there reigned a mighty empire known as the Kingdom of Dole. Renowned far and wide for its golden bananas, pristine pineapples, and a cornucopia of fresh produce, Dole was the epitome of agricultural excellence. The kingdom was ruled by a council of elders who believed that nothing could topple their fruity dominion.

One sunny morning, whispers began to spread about a looming threat called the ""Tropical Rumble 4"" (TR4), a mischievous goblin rumored to wreak havoc on banana crops. ""Nonsense!"" scoffed the elders. ""Our bananas have weathered storms, pests, and even that one time when Farmer Bob forgot to water the fields. This TR4 is but a myth!""

Meanwhile, in the shadows, a band of rogue scientists proposed a radical idea: using ""Magic Growth Orbs"" (MGOs) to protect the bananas. ""Absolutely not!"" declared the elders. ""Our kingdom's reputation is built on natural goodness. We can't taint it with sorcery!""

As fate would have it, TR4 was no myth. The goblin began its mischief, turning bananas into squishy messes overnight. Panic ensued. Markets faced shortages, and citizens started hoarding bananas like they were gold. The famed Banana Festival was at risk!

Desperate times called for desperate measures. The elders convened an emergency meeting. ""Perhaps those MGOs aren't such a bad idea after all,"" one mumbled. ""But what will our people think? They'll never accept magically enhanced bananas!""

To address the crisis, the kingdom launched a grand campaign: ""New Bananas, Same Great Peel!"" They plastered posters of smiling citizens holding glowing bananas and hosted free banana-tasting events. The initial reactions were... mixed.

""Why is my banana glowing in the dark?"" one citizen asked. ""Is this safe?"" questioned another as their banana started to hum a catchy tune.

Amidst the chaos, neighboring kingdoms watched with amusement. The Pineapple Principality sent a cheeky note: ""Need any help? Our pineapples are goblin-free!"" The Berry Barony chimed in, ""Maybe it's time to diversify your fruits!""

Facing public outcry and international jest, the elders had an epiphany. They decided to embrace transparency. Hosting a kingdom-wide assembly, they admitted their oversight. ""We got a bit... bananas,"" they confessed. ""We should have listened and acted sooner.""

The kingdom then took a new approach. They collaborated with farmers, scientists, and even welcomed input from the citizens. Together, they developed sustainable methods to protect their crops without relying solely on MGOs. They diversified their produce, introducing new fruits like starfruit and dragonfruit, which delighted the populace.

The TR4 goblin, seeing that it was no longer effective, packed up and moved to a secluded cave, muttering about its lost mischief.

In the end, the Kingdom of Dole emerged stronger and wiser. They learned that adaptability, open-mindedness, and listening to their community were the real magic needed to thrive.

And so, the Banana Festival was not only saved but expanded to celebrate all fruits. The elders even started a new tradition of sharing embarrassing stories to keep themselves humble—a favorite being ""The Great Banana Blunder.""

**Moral of the story:** Sometimes, it's not the slippery banana peel that makes us fall, but our own stubbornness. Embracing change and a little humor can prevent a whole lot of bruises!","

Facing public outcry and international jest, the elders had an epiphany. They decided to embrace transparency. Hosting a kingdom-wide assembly, they admitted their oversight. ""We got a bit... bananas,"" they confessed. ""We should have listened and acted sooner.""

The kingdom then took a new approach. They collaborated with farmers, scientists, and even welcomed input from the citizens. Together, they developed sustainable methods to protect their crops without relying solely on MGOs. They diversified their produce, introducing new fruits like starfruit and dragonfruit, which delighted the populace.

The TR4 goblin, seeing that it was no longer effective, packed up and moved to a secluded cave, muttering about its lost mischief.

In the end, the Kingdom of Dole emerged stronger and wiser. They learned that adaptability, open-mindedness, and listening to their community were the real magic needed to thrive.

And so, the Banana Festival was not only saved but expanded to celebrate all fruits. The elders even started a new tradition of sharing embarrassing stories to keep themselves humble—a favorite being ""The Great Banana Blunder.""

**Moral of the story:** Sometimes, it's not the slippery banana peel that makes us fall, but our own stubbornness. Embracing change and a little humor can prevent a whole lot of bruises!",-8,,,,reddit

I feel like putting as much cash into gold as you could afford, and even buying assets like luxury art or collectables could be a safe place to put wealth until things cooled down - could potentially even sell towards the recovery period for profit.

I know what you’re talking about. My humble advice to you is to buy USD and keep it as cash since it’s current exchange rate is at least 40% less than what it should be under “normal” conditions and -as expected- they have to lower the interest rates in this country soon so in that case the USD exchange rate will go up as sky is the limit kind.

Another option you have is to invest on US ETFs. Don’t buy gold though.

This is why you’re getting scammed. “It has value because people think it has value”. Okay, so what happens when everyone who “thinks it has value” wants to sell their valuables? Oh, it’s immediately no longer valuable?

You cold have gotten a 3% match on transfers (that is literally 10's of thousands of dollars in my case) and 3% on contributions **on top** of **another** 3% bonus on contributions. They also have a deal for 1% matching on money sitting in their regular brokerage account with 5x the insurance of tons of other brokerages and often higher interest rates on non-invested money there for say an efund. They also give you an interest free $1000 you can use to make money by just putting it in a treasury fund and making ~50 bucks a year off it. 

Tbh, the easy way to make this clear is to ask someone to show something that beats it. They won't be able to. As for GME, it wasn't a Robinhood thing. People are just ignorant there and don't know how trading mechanics work or what regulations are. GME was stopped by Clearinghouse and not Robinhood. It's why it wasn't **at all** limited to Robinhood on it being stopped in tons of places. Real investors don't really care about meme stocks like that anyhow since they're typically too busy choosing more serious investments rather than memes. 

Been using em for 7+ years. Been using Vanguard for years now too and Fidelity as well. I average several brokerages in fact and RH simply has the best deals. They're SPIC insured and follow SEC regulations all the same. They also have billions in under management and helped lead a movement to commission free trading to help the market as a whole just like Vanguard helped in the ER game. Now they're helping by doing something the market hasn't seen before in actually paying folks to invest. 

Your friends have a huge advantage over your Vanguard account in that they can even exceed the standard annual contribution limits of an IRA through their bonuses. Gold pays for itself several times over for those regularly investing and has a plethora of perks that are pretty nice in general. You are right folks will hate on reddit though. Just aks them to show you what beats their IRA matches though and they'll try to change the subject rather than give you anything.","It currently has the best IRA products on the market. Respect when you compare the UI/UX from Vanguard to RH for example. Vanguard doesn't pu much into that at all.

You cold have gotten a 3% match on transfers (that is literally 10's of thousands of dollars in my case) and 3% on contributions **on top** of **another** 3% bonus on contributions. They also have a deal for 1% matching on money sitting in their regular brokerage account with 5x the insurance of tons of other brokerages and often higher interest rates on non-invested money there for say an efund. They also give you an interest free $1000 you can use to make money by just putting it in a treasury fund and making ~50 bucks a year off it. 

Tbh, the easy way to make this clear is to ask someone to show something that beats it. They won't be able to. As for GME, it wasn't a Robinhood thing. People are just ignorant there and don't know how trading mechanics work or what regulations are. GME was stopped by Clearinghouse and not Robinhood. It's why it wasn't **at all** limited to Robinhood on it being stopped in tons of places. Real investors don't really care about meme stocks like that anyhow since they're typically too busy choosing more serious investments rather than memes. 

Been using em for 7+ years. Been using Vanguard for years now too and Fidelity as well. I average several brokerages in fact and RH simply has the best deals. They're SPIC insured and follow SEC regulations all the same. They also have billions in under management and helped lead a movement to commission free trading to help the market as a whole just like Vanguard helped in the ER game. Now they're helping by doing something the market hasn't seen before in actually paying folks to invest.

These guys are crushing the solar game. Their microinverters are like the iPhone of solar panels - sleek, smart, and totally next-level. With solar power booming, ENPH is riding that wave straight to the bank. Shits going to fly, hear me out.

Enphase's profits have been skyrocketing. They're making bank, like, serious bank. With this kind of cash flow, they can do whatever they want: more R&D, bigger marketing campaigns, or just straight-up shareholder dividends.

Since its inception, ENPH's stock price has skyrocketed. It's grown like weed, outpacing the market by a mile. With this kind of growth, you could be swimming in cash in no time.

People are saying this shit is going to a thousand bucks a share. A THOUSAND! That's enough cash to buy a fleet of Lambos and a personal harem of hotties. I'm talking supermodels, ballerinas, the whole nine yards.

So yeah, if you wanna live the high life, ENPH is the way to go. Just remember, do your own research, don't take financial advice from some random dude on the internet.

But hey, if you're feeling risky, ENPH might be your golden ticket to a life of luxury, excess, and debauchery. Sign me up.","Alright, let's talk serious money, bro. Enphase Energy, ticker symbol ENPH, is straight fire. It's like the ultimate get-rich-quick scheme. Some are saying it’s fire.

Hi everyone,  

I’m a 20 years old business economics student from Belgium and just getting started with investing. I will graduate 2026 and after this I want to work another 1-2 years from home to save for my own house.   
  
My current portfolio is made up of ETFs (see breakdown below), but I’m currently down €82 (-2.39%). Some of my holdings, like \*\*iShares MSCI China\*\*, are really underperforming (-13.99%), while others, like \*\*Xtrackers MSCI USA Information Tech\*\*, are doing quite well (+7.17%).  



\### \*\*Portfolio Overview:\*\*

I’m particularly puzzled by the performance of the \*\*VanEck Defense ETF\*\*. With rising geopolitical tensions, I thought it would perform better, but it’s slightly down (-0.79%).

In simple terms banks comingle money, you deposit money into a bank and you become a creditor the bank owes you money. If the bank is bad at business and makes bad loans it may not be able to pay you back, and this can happen with out fraud

SVB as far as I know did not engage in any ""fraud"" as far as I know. They just mismanaged interest rate risk. They got a TON of money and deposits in 2020 and 2021 when rates were near zero, they then bought longer term bonds. Lots of their customers were start ups, so what do start ups do raise cash then spend the cash .

So in 2022 and 2023 its customers were burning through and withdrawing cash and as rates rose its bond holdings fell and well they became insolvent, as far as I know there was no fraud , but they still failed and that is possible with a bank

Brokerages do not comingle funds, think of it more like a safety deposit box. Using a banking analogy imagine you have a safety deposit box with a bank, and in that box you put things like gold coins, trading cards , diamonds or what ever.

If the bank fails it cannot just confiscate the assets in your safety deposit box, its creditors cannot say ""The bank owes us money so we are just going to lay claim to all the stuff in their safety deposit box"" , in fact if the bank opens your safety deposit box and takes your gold and goes to the pawn shop to sell it that is fraud

Thats sort of like how holding assets at a brokerage works, if Jeff Bezos holds 500 million Amazon shares at fidelity , fidelity cannot just take those shares and sell them if they need money. If Fidelity has creditors it cannot pay back, those creditors cannot lay claim to those 500 million shares

So the key difference is this, banks can lose your money while not committing any fraud, in a brokerage the only way assets go missing is if there IS fraud

As long as the brokerage isn't committing fraud there is no real way you can lose assets , now there are cases were a brokerage does comite fraud MF global comes to mind ; MF global was a brokerage but they also had a prop trading desk from my understanding and made some very bad bets and basically to cover those bets they stole their brokerage customers money , this is very illegal and is considered fraud.","No, this question gets asked a lot and brokerages and banks are vastly different business

Let's say someone has some US cash to invest. The equities market, gold, and crypto are all at or near record highs. Mortgage rates are high, so real estate might not be an option (though I suppose REITs could be).  

While the US equities market has pretty consistently been the best investment vehicle worldwide for 85 years, I am concerned the incoming US administration will screw something up badly and irrevocably - Japan tanked their economy in the 90s and never really recovered before they started falling off the demographic cliff, the UK Brexited themselves, and something on that scale or larger totally could happen here. 

What's cheap right now? 

Obviously to some extent the answer will depend on age, asset levels, financial goals, and risk tolerance, but I'm curious about what the general playing field looks like in this situation, is there an accepted strategy for what to do when everything is expensive, etc.","Let's say someone has some US cash to invest.

A quick rule of thumb to differentiate between investing and speculating is that the ""Greater Fool Theory"" doesn't apply to investing.  
  
You don't rely on meeting someone dumber than you when you are investing.  It's investing when you pay money to create a business or to acquire an ownership stake in a business because there is a very clear path to you making returns on that investment that doesn't require you to meet a stupid person later.  The thing you (partially) own will sell things above their costs (hopefully) and you will deserve a share of that excess in proportion to your stake.

If you buy a gold bar, it doesn't somehow grow in size so you have more gold.  You will always have the same mass of gold until you sell it.  The only way you gain is by someone else offering to pay more than you offered to pay, IE a bigger fool.

Digital coins are the same as gold, except much worse.  At least with gold you can perhaps make it into something (create a business around your ownership of it) and you can't do that with digital coins.  Digital coins can't be turned into diamond rings or anything else in order to improve upon the worth of what you have.  It just sits there.

Your best hope is to let someone borrow it from you and then they pay you interest for that privilege, which would have you building a banking sort of business and taking on banking sort of risks.  You could do that with any asset equally well so it is nothing in favor of digital coins.

At least with a digital coin, you don't have to worry about it being physically stolen, as perhaps you might with a gold bar.  You do perhaps have more of a risk of it being digitally stolen, however, so that's no ""win"".

Generally speaking, very few people achieve meaningful wealth through speculation and the vast majority of all wealth is generated through actual investing.  On this grounds, I would advise against putting money into digital coins.","Digital coins aren't investments just like gold isn't an investment.

At least with gold you can perhaps make it into something (create a business around your ownership of it) and you can't do that with digital coins.  Digital coins can't be turned into diamond rings or anything else in order to improve upon the worth of what you have.  It just sits there.

Your best hope is to let someone borrow it from you and then they pay you interest for that privilege, which would have you building a banking sort of business and taking on banking sort of risks.  You could do that with any asset equally well so it is nothing in favor of digital coins.

At least with a digital coin, you don't have to worry about it being physically stolen, as perhaps you might with a gold bar.  You do perhaps have more of a risk of it being digitally stolen, however, so that's no ""win"".

Generally speaking, very few people achieve meaningful wealth through speculation and the vast majority of all wealth is generated through actual investing.  On this grounds, I would advise against putting money into digital coins.",2,,,,reddit

YouTube infrastructure is so massive that the economies of scale are unheard of.  Their CDN is second to none so a lot of what people think must be expensive for them is really offloaded to the end of the distribution line, ISPs and related parties.


> and don’t forget YouTube still needs to pay out the YouTube Creators 55% of all ad revenue.

Yeah... imagine only getting paid 45 cents of every dollar for doing nothing.  I’ll take it.  I assume you recognize MasterCard and visa as financial powerhouses?  They do it by skimming 1.75 to 2%.  So skimming 45% is pretty damn lucrative.  Even greedy Apple only skims 30%, and I’m sure you’d agree Apple is lucrative too.

YouTube is a gold mine.  And for reasons that should be obvious, Google is very happy continung to keep that under the radar for as long as they have.

But back to the key point: YouTube is a wonderful monstrously profitable busones with or without google docs.   Google cloud is a wodnefuly profitable monster with or without Waymo.  And so on.

Your implication that YouTube is some bordlering flesging operation than can only turn a profit if it’s kept together is totally false.

> Also… Google Cloud’s biggest selling point over AWS and Azure is that it’s integrated with Google 

False as false could be.

> Like… you can take your website traffic from Google Search and run your data analytics on Cloud.

Wait, you think those are the only ways to track traffic and that there’s no competition in analytics?  You’re talking nonsense my friend.



> The whole thing works together because it does.

Yeah... no.","> I do find it interesting how Google never reveals how much profit YouTube actually generates. I don’t doubt it’s profitable, 

Yes they do, and it’s absurdly profitable.  It has been for many years.

A lot of people don’t realize that because they’ve been fed the nonsensical lie that Netflix is the only airquotes profitable streamer.  People have been erroneously trained to forget that YouTube exists and is a streaming service.

Over the past few years I’ve built a portfolio consisting of S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK. It has done rather well, consistently giving returns of 25%+ annually (except 2022). 

However in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned. I just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

So saying all this I’m considering: 

50% S&P

10% Hood

10% Rddt

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Quick rationale for each:

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold 

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Lunr & ASTS: Moonshot (literally), this is just in case space works out and much more speculative

So having said all that, what is everyone’s thoughts on this proposed portfolio allocation. Is this too risky, not enough diversification into the different sectors? Any thoughts and opinions on this would be great!","Over the past few years I’ve built a portfolio consisting of S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK.

im looking to prepare my protfolio for a recession and/or inflation.   

there are a few reasons i feel like i should start prepping: 1. the dollar index is trending high.  2. PE average is very high.  3. sprialing USD debt 4. workers may be doported.  5. there may be a lot of unemployed federal employees.  (im not judging those things and lets not debate the the merrit of those things in the investing forum.) 

I was trying to figure out what would be a good place to park some money in the event that im right.  im thinking commodies, consumer staples

heres what im thinking.  

philip morris PE 9, yeild 7.  

AT and T.  PE 18 yeild 5, 

Gold miners GDX PE 31, 

consumer staples XLP PE 31, yeild 2.6

BRK which has a PE of 9.6 (but what does that really mean with BRK anyway)

money market which is getting about 4.5% right now with fidelity.  

  
I was thinking 50% in brk, then 25% money markets, then split the rest 

  
i worried about the consumer staples and gold miners funds though, because if i believe the PEs will fall, these fund is aready around 30, so may not be great.  

please give me your ideas where to invest if we do have recession/inflation due to these factors

Then I found WSB, and learned that Papa Musk was serving tendies, so I dumped my chump change Nokia for **Tesla**. No calls, no puts—just pure Papa Musk hopium. My portfolio was mooning daily, and I thought I was a goddamn financial prodigy.

Hi I'm not from Us and I didn't invest in S&P bc there isnt easy way to do it like thru apps like Vanguard as I know and I have to pay and calculate my capital gains taxes to 2 countries but its safe good index fund but yesterday I compared gold and s&p returns and

Last 5 Years Gold: %77.1 - S&P(All dividens reinvested + Inflation adjusted): 71.6

Last 10 Years Gold: %116.2 - S&P(All dividens reinvested + Inflation adjusted): 168.7

Last 20 Years Gold: %532.7 - S&P(All dividens reinvested + Inflation adjusted): 359.1

I would still rather S&P If I were not to pay 2 taxes plus its more stable than gold but I cant say S&P clearly better than gold am I missing something ?

> I sort of agree, but I don’t know what to think about slashing the government by my instincts tell me, all things being equal(unlikely, I know) this will raise the value of dollars. Unlike cutting taxes and tariffs.

I think slashing government (IE: reducing spending) would in theory raise the value of the dollar by making people less worried about the massive debt, but incoming administration has actually approved more borrowing during their presidency last time than any prior administration. Additionally, I expect them to lower interest rates because it's the popular thing to do not because it's the long-term healthy thing for the economy to do.

If rates are slashed too fast, and government overspends I see two potential things happening:

* Higher Inflation, which at low interest rates makes investing in treasuries absolutely useless.
* Public Companies being more capable of isolating themselves from being dependent on the dollar and just look out for themselves

The main point I wanted to highlight is that in this scenario CDs are not safe because CDs are essentially dependent on Treasury being sane to function.

After some research, I really beleive this stock is gold:

Viking Therapeutics shared updates on its obesity treatment program for VK2735 at ObesityWeek:

Subjects achieved mean weight loss of up to 8.2% from baseline and 6.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss after 28 days of daily dosing at 100 mg. As far as I am concerned, I believe this is more effective than Mounjaro which demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately 4% of starting body weight after 4 weeks of treatment. 

Also, Oral VK2735 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with 99% of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. The oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatments by offering greater convenience. 

Let’s look at subcutaneous VK2735 Result(or like doses): Weekly subcutaneous injections led to weight reductions of up to 14.7% from baseline. Up to 88% of treated patients achieved ≥10% weight loss, compared to 4% for placebo. Weight loss was progressive throughout the study, with no plateau at 13 weeks.

The obesity drug market is projected to grow to $130 billion by 2030, offering significant upside for VK2735. This is also important because at this size of a market, it can hold many or multiple big players. Analysts also predict Viking could become a takeover target due to its strong pipeline. This would boost the price up to 3 digits.

What’s more! The company also received praise for its liver disease treatment VK2809, which showed positive results in a Phase 2b trial for MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), a serious liver condition affecting 22 million Americans. Reductions in liver fat ranging from 37% to 55% at 52 weeks, with response rates (≥30% reduction) as high as 88%, far exceed typical benchmarks. 

The clinical data reinforce VK2735's potential as a best-in-class obesity treatment with effective weight loss, strong safety, and durability of results. The only reason why the stock hasn’t sky-rocketed is because of fear mongering by market makers in the aftermath of RFK junior, and as far as I’m concerned, diabete and liver diseases will not go away and the desperation I’ve seen for patients to obtain these drug is mad.","After some research, I really beleive this stock is gold:

Viking Therapeutics shared updates on its obesity treatment program for VK2735 at ObesityWeek:

Subjects achieved mean weight loss of up to 8.2% from baseline and 6.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss after 28 days of daily dosing at 100 mg. As far as I am concerned, I believe this is more effective than Mounjaro which demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately 4% of starting body weight after 4 weeks of treatment. 

Also, Oral VK2735 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with 99% of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. The oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatments by offering greater convenience. 

Let’s look at subcutaneous VK2735 Result(or like doses): Weekly subcutaneous injections led to weight reductions of up to 14.7% from baseline. Up to 88% of treated patients achieved ≥10% weight loss, compared to 4% for placebo. Weight loss was progressive throughout the study, with no plateau at 13 weeks.

The obesity drug market is projected to grow to $130 billion by 2030, offering significant upside for VK2735. This is also important because at this size of a market, it can hold many or multiple big players. Analysts also predict Viking could become a takeover target due to its strong pipeline. This would boost the price up to 3 digits.

What’s more! The company also received praise for its liver disease treatment VK2809, which showed positive results in a Phase 2b trial for MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), a serious liver condition affecting 22 million Americans. Reductions in liver fat ranging from 37% to 55% at 52 weeks, with response rates (≥30% reduction) as high as 88%, far exceed typical benchmarks. 

The clinical data reinforce VK2735's potential as a best-in-class obesity treatment with effective weight loss, strong safety, and durability of results. The only reason why the stock hasn’t sky-rocketed is because of fear mongering by market makers in the aftermath of RFK junior, and as far as I’m concerned, diabete and liver diseases will not go away and the desperation I’ve seen for patients to obtain these drug is mad. ",1,29.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwvb46/how_is_viking_therapeutics_inc_not_a_no_brainer/,/r/stocks/comments/1gwvb46/how_is_viking_therapeutics_inc_not_a_no_brainer/,reddit

2024-11-22,GLD,stocks,post,1gx83cf,,,Thoughts on building a 10Y high risk portfolio,"Thoughts on building a 10Y high risk portfolio
Over the past few years I’ve built a portfolio consisting of S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK. It has done rather well, consistently giving returns of 25%+ annually (except 2022). 

However in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned. I just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

So saying all this I’m considering: 

50% S&P

10% Hood

10% Rddt

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Quick rationale for each:

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold 

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Lunr & ASTS: Moonshot (literally), this is just in case space works out and much more speculative 



So having said all that, what is everyone’s thoughts on this proposed portfolio allocation. Is this too risky, not enough diversification into the different sectors? Any thoughts and opinions on this would be great!","Over the past few years I’ve built a portfolio consisting of S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK.

By losing very little principal during drawdowns, it avoids the ""[volatility tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_tax)"" that crushes your long-term CAGR. In its original 1999 incarnation, the portfolio was divided according to this rubric:

* 25% equities (can be represented by SPY)
* 25% long-term bonds (can be represented by TLT)
* 25% gold (can be represented by GLD)
* 25% cash (can be represented by SHY or a savings account)

Ray Dalio's twist on it during the 2000s was to apply external leverage to juice returns. The original's Sharpe ratio was 0.6 and Dalio pushed it back up to 1, accruing better ROI with the same volatility as SPY. Recently Porter Stansberry introduced his version which is predicated on internal leverage and filtering criteria for equities. The actual details are too long for this post, but the idea of internal leverage^1 to increase returns without increasing risk exposure has been bouncing around in my mind. 

For the last six months I've been theorycrafting a barbell portfolio whose short end can be converted to produce high convexity returns during a market drawdown. The key word here is *converted*: I was looking for a bond substitute that was liquid enough to be turned into a security with non-linear returns on short notice. During period of crisis for the bond market, long-term securities can become extremely illiquid as the buyer side dries up. In such instances you are stuck with a ""risk free"" asset that's rapidly depreciating in value. Simultaneously I wanted to avoid the main issue with relying on the Sharpe ratio - it forces your CAGR to converge with the general market during good times. We want a setup that outperforms when the market's hot and offers better principal protection when it's cold. 

After doing some research and crunching numbers since the beginning of May, I arrived at the following portfolio:

* 30% equities, replacing SPY with high-quality companies adhering to strict criteria.
* 30% gold and other precious/industrial metals, leveraged through exposure to high-quality companies adhering to strict criteria. 
* 20% option strategies high win rate, high profit factor options strategies using Kelly Criterion to determine allocation. These replace bonds entirely. 
* 20% cash, preferably in a MMF or saving accounts with an interest rate that tracks inflation. 

The big departure is replacing the fixed income portion of bonds and substituting it with options. It probably sounds ludicrous for those who view options as speculative, but that's due to retail primarily using options for speculation. They don't employ a systematic approach to generating profit and curtailing risk. Yet there are several ways to approximate the function of bonds to get sequential cash flow^3. The tradeoff is accepting moderately higher risk for much better return, and the risk can be ameliorated.  


* In theory, you stand to lose your entire premium if the option expires worthless. In reality, it is easy to set up contracts so that you retain time premium and exit them to preserve the majority of your capital. Unless you're running a 0DTE, you should never lose more than 25%. 
* Since these strategies piggyback off the embedded behavior of institutions, they are agnostic to the state of the market. It doesn't matter if it is in a bullish, bearish, or sideways period.
* As these income option contracts are primarily short duration, the cash from premiums + returns can be invested into longer-dated puts during market corrections. At the bottom of bear markets, the cash flow can be diverted into equities.
* Repeatable options strategies are not that rare. For example, there is a multi-leg setup that has a historical win rate of 90% with an average 20% return per winning transaction and a 13:1 profit factor. When we exclude compounding and focus on a fixed initial stake executed once per week, you will generate roughly 600% return on that investment over 40 weeks. The general loss when it fails is 5-10% with an occasional dip below 20%. There are strategies based on gamma exposure, anchored VWAP on stocks with strong upwards/downward momentum, 0DTE credit spreads, selling contracts on blue-chips during periods of momentary weakness, etc. that succeed 80-95% of the time once you filter for ideal candidates and set the appropriate contract parameters.
* As a corollary to 3 and 4, the outsized profit factor allows you to allocate more to equities and commodities while maintaining a low Sharpe ratio. The returns are cycled into cash on a weekly basis, which gives you the flexibility to change portfolio distribution based on the state of the market. 

^1 The difference between external leverage and internal leverage is how the investment produces outsized returns. External leverage is increasing the base return on an investment by using debt and pledging collateral against said debt. This debt is independent of the investment, such as a margin account. Internal leverage is selecting securities whose price movement amplifies changes in the underlying environment or asset, treating the security as a first order derivative. Think of junior miners that go up 500%, 1000%, 5000% during a gold bull market. The key to using internal leverage successfully is to get exposure to upside volatility while mitigating downside volatility, using a combination of allocation size and selecting capital-efficient proxies with good management. Leveraged ETFs are not considered.

^2 Bonds are simply a debt contract between the issuer and the holder where the latter assumes reliable, predictable behavior from the former. In the case of the U.S. government, the holder assumes the government is both solvent and fulfill their obligations. Guess what that also describes? An options contract. The difference is, as a holder, are counting on consistent behavior from the major institutions who control 80-85% of all transaction volume.","If you're familiar with Harry Browne's Permanent Portfolio, you know the entire idea is to match the performance of the market with a lower Sharpe ratio.

Overview of the Crisis

McDonald’s is facing a brewing crisis as its Melitta espresso machines have been decommissioned across 13,500 U.S. locations due to unspecified safety concerns. This operational hiccup doesn’t just mean no lattes, cappuccinos, or mochas—it’s a potential $193 million blow to the company’s bottom line over the next 60 days if the issue isn’t resolved quickly. And the stakes? They’re steep—impacting 13% of McDonald’s quarterly profit.

Let’s break down the numbers, the scenarios, and the potential outcomes for the Golden Arches.

The Financial Breakdown

McDonald’s daily customer base in the U.S. is an impressive 27.2 million. Of these:
	•	810,000 customers order espresso-based drinks daily.
	•	Lost revenue per day from espresso drinks: $2.4M.
	•	Lost meal revenue (30% of espresso drinkers skip meals entirely): $1.2M.

Total daily profit loss? $2.55M.

With replacement machines costing $3,000 each, the replacement cost alone hits $40.5M across 13,500 stores.

Scenario Analysis

1. Fast Rollout (35 Days)

	•	Total Lost Profit: $89.3M
	•	Replacement Cost: $40.5M
	•	Total Financial Impact: $129.8M
	•	Hit to Quarterly Profit: ~9%

2. Slow Rollout (90 Days)

	•	Total Lost Profit: $193.59M
	•	Replacement Cost: $40.5M
	•	Total Financial Impact: $234.09M
	•	Hit to Quarterly Profit: ~15.3%

3. Phase-Out (No Repair)

	•	Total Financial Impact: ~$200M+ (Lost espresso customers long-term)
	•	Hit to Quarterly Profit: ~13-15%
	•	Key Risk: Permanent reputational damage as a consistent coffee provider.

4. Previous Analysis (60-Day Downtime)

	•	Total Lost Profit: $153.09M
	•	Replacement Cost: $40.5M
	•	Total Financial Impact: $193.59M
	•	Hit to Quarterly Profit: ~12.9%

Cumulative Losses Over Time

Here’s how losses add up as time drags on:

Days	Fast Rollout ($M)	Slow Rollout ($M)	Previous Analysis ($M)
21	53.5	59.5	53.5
35	89.3	99.5	89.3
60	-	153.1	153.1
90	-	230.1	-

What’s at Stake?

	1.	Consumer Trust
McDonald’s markets itself as a reliable, consistent brand. Pulling espresso drinks off the menu threatens that perception, especially for customers who rely on it for their daily caffeine fix. Long-term losses may extend beyond these numbers if competitors like Starbucks or Dunkin’ capitalize.
	2.	Operational Efficiency
McDonald’s is known for moving fast, but delays in resolving the issue risk turning this into another “broken ice cream machine” meme—damaging both reputation and sales.
	3.	Investor Confidence
A 13% drop in quarterly profit could lead to significant downward pressure on McDonald’s stock price. While McDonald’s has proven resilient in the past, analysts will scrutinize its ability to handle this crisis efficiently.

The Best Strategy

The fast rollout (35 days) emerges as the most effective approach:
	•	Minimizes financial losses to $129.8M.
	•	Limits damage to quarterly profits to ~9%.
	•	Restores consumer confidence quickly, preventing long-term reputational damage.

Conclusion

The stakes for McDonald’s are high. Whether it’s a short-term blip or a long-term headache depends on how quickly the company acts. Investors, employees, and customers alike are watching closely. The Golden Arches have weathered storms before—can they handle this one?

Sources

	•	Internal financial projections based on daily U.S. customer traffic and product sales.
	•	Equipment cost and operational data sourced from verified supplier insights.
	•	Historical McDonald’s operational analysis (e.g., ice cream machine downtime comparisons).","Anecdotal but I left and went somewhere else. I’m not drinking or eating that shit without that  🔥 in me.

21	53.5	59.5	53.5
35	89.3	99.5	89.3
60	-	153.1	153.1
90	-	230.1	-

What’s at Stake?

	1.	Consumer Trust
McDonald’s markets itself as a reliable, consistent brand. Pulling espresso drinks off the menu threatens that perception, especially for customers who rely on it for their daily caffeine fix. Long-term losses may extend beyond these numbers if competitors like Starbucks or Dunkin’ capitalize.
	2.	Operational Efficiency
McDonald’s is known for moving fast, but delays in resolving the issue risk turning this into another “broken ice cream machine” meme—damaging both reputation and sales.
	3.	Investor Confidence
A 13% drop in quarterly profit could lead to significant downward pressure on McDonald’s stock price. While McDonald’s has proven resilient in the past, analysts will scrutinize its ability to handle this crisis efficiently.

The Best Strategy

The fast rollout (35 days) emerges as the most effective approach:
	•	Minimizes financial losses to $129.8M.
	•	Limits damage to quarterly profits to ~9%.
	•	Restores consumer confidence quickly, preventing long-term reputational damage.

Conclusion

The stakes for McDonald’s are high. Whether it’s a short-term blip or a long-term headache depends on how quickly the company acts. Investors, employees, and customers alike are watching closely. The Golden Arches have weathered storms before—can they handle this one?

This is weird. 

McDonald’s (MCD) is scrambling faster than a breakfast egg because their Melitta espresso machines just got yeeted out of every U.S. store. Safety concerns = no lattes, no cappuccinos, no mocha frappes. 🍮 A total 13,500 stores affected = $193M in financial black holes. But wait—it gets worse. If they don’t fix this fast, this could be McDonald’s ice cream machine scandal 2.0—with espresso.

The Drama
You know how they’re always like, “Sorry, the ice cream machine’s broken”? Well, now the espresso machines are dead too. McDonald’s had to RIP them out of every U.S. location because of some “unspecified safety concern.” I mean, who’s getting hurt by a cappuccino? Karen’s third-degree burn from asking for “extra hot”? 🔥☕

The Numbers
Here’s where it gets wild, fam. McDonald’s serves 27.2M customers a day in the U.S.:
	•	810K espresso drinks lost per day = $2.4M/day in lost sales.
	•	People skipping meals because no coffee = another $1.2M/day gone.
	•	That’s $153M in lost profit if this drags on for 60 days.
	•	Oh, and replacing the machines? Another $40.5M.

Total burn? $193M. That’s nearly **13% of their quarterly","This is weird.

Gold and silver is fine too, I personally do 90% VOO and 10% physical gold cause it’s beautiful, it should perform well if we have a market crash, keeps up with inflation long term, I can feel it and know it’s real, there isn’t a value number on it when I look at it so I’m not concerned with the price. It’s also less convenient to sell because you have to physically take it somewhere to be evaluated and or mail it in. I only do 10% because I’m young and the stock market has historically performed better than gold long term.

Note: Some folks would advise bonds instead of gold but I just can’t get into it at current yields.

2024-11-24,GLD,investing,comment,1gyfm52,lyoxzbe,t1_lyotnzj,,"Going to be hard to get intelligent conversations here. But here is my take on your question as well as some other consideration. 

During a market correction or drawdown, the performance of different asset classes varies based on the nature of the correction, interest rate environment, and economic backdrop. Here’s how some common options—utility ETFs, real estate ETFs, and bonds—typically behave and which provide better protection:

1. Utility ETFs

	Performance During Drawdowns: Utility ETFs (e.g., XLU - Utilities Select Sector SPDR) are considered defensive due to their stable cash flows and essential services (electricity, water, etc.).
	Advantages:
	   Generally less volatile than the broader market.
	    Dividend-paying, providing income during periods of uncertainty.
	Drawbacks:
	   May still decline during corrections, especially if interest rates rise, as utilities are sensitive to bond yields.
	    Effectiveness: Moderate protection. Utilities tend to outperform during corrections but may lag if the selloff is due to rising interest rates.

2. Real Estate ETFs

           Performance During Drawdowns: Real estate ETFs (e.g., VNQ - Vanguard Real Estate ETF) are less consistent in providing protection because their performance is tied to economic conditions and interest rates.
	       Advantages:
              Real estate often serves as a hedge against inflation in a low-rate environment.
	       Provides income through REIT dividends.
	       Drawbacks:
	       Sensitive to rising interest rates, as higher borrowing costs hurt real estate profits.
	       Can underperform in recessions or economic downturns.
	       Effectiveness: Low-to-moderate protection. Real estate ETFs may not perform well if the correction is driven by recession fears or rising rates.

3. Bonds

	        Bonds are traditionally seen as a safe haven during market corrections, but their effectiveness depends on the type of bonds and the interest rate environment.
	        Treasury Bonds:
                Long-Term Bonds (e.g., TLT - iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF):
	         Provide strong protection during equity market selloffs, especially if rates fall as investors seek safety.
	         Highly sensitive to interest rate changes.
	         Short-Term Bonds (e.g., SHY - iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF):
	         Provide more stability during rate changes but offer lower returns.
	         Good for preserving capital during volatile periods.
	         Corporate Bonds:
	         Investment-Grade Bonds (e.g., LQD - iShares Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF):
	         Provide moderate protection but can be affected by credit risk in severe downturns.
	         High-Yield Bonds (e.g., HYG - iShares High Yield Corporate Bond ETF):
	         Poor protection during corrections due to higher default risk.
	         Effectiveness: Treasury bonds (particularly long-term) offer the best protection during corrections, especially when interest rates are declining.

Conclusion: Best for Protection

	1.	Treasury Bonds (Long-Term): Historically the most reliable hedge during equity market corrections. Best choice if the correction coincides with falling interest rates or economic uncertainty.
	2.	Utility ETFs: Defensive but may be less effective if corrections are caused by rising rates.
	3.	Real Estate ETFs: Provide moderate protection but are vulnerable in rate-driven corrections or economic

For one, gold is *too* valuable, so it wasn’t useful for common items that were more frequently bought rather than produced or bartered. That’s why other precious metals like silver or copper were also used. 

But debasement was often a very common problem, both with respect to the people using the coins (via things like clipping) and with respect to the government, who might issue coins with “less gold” in them, alloying with other metals to “reduce production costs”.","Gold was historically a *bad* money, just the least worst of others tried at the time.

Paul J. Fribourg, one of Estee Lauder’s directors, initiated a massive buying spree on the 15th and the 18th. Between those two dates he bought roughly $10 million worth of stock.  

As mentioned last week, there was a set of calls totaling a massive $2,200,000 on Under Armour (UAA) expiring on December 27th at $8 strike. What makes this bet so intriguing is it’s placed deep in the money, not ATM or at targeted future price. The most likely candidate for a catalyst is their Investor Day scheduled for December 12th. 

Technical signals imply UPST is preparing for a short squeeze. Short interest is 24.6%, daily EMAs from 8 to 55 are bullish, and the histogram is showing a switch back into bullish momentum.

It’s highly likely that Fort Knox has no or little physical gold secured in its vaults. From the Clinton era onwards, rehypothecation policies meant central banks had loaned out their stores to bullion banks in exchange for minor yields on the underlying asset (in a manner resembling fixed income securities). The IOUs issued by said banks will probably never be fulfilled; they sold off the gold to non-government entities, assuming it would never regain status as a medium of exchange.","Opening thoughts for the week:

AppLovin is a mobile technology company that provides a comprehensive suite of solutions to help businesses, particularly mobile app developers, grow and monetize their products. Their tools connect with 1.4 billion through mobile, TV, and other platforms. They support mobile ads through an AI/ML process to design and place ads.  They make 350+ of their own apps that bring profit through in-app purchases and ads, but also is a goldmine of data that feeds the AI/ML platforms. 

YTD: +764.20%

3 months: +277.96%

1 month: +108.24%

1 week: +15.76%

Market cap is $111 billion.  I own 3.65 shares, i’m a dork, but their line chart is consistently green.  I'll keep my $1200 in there and pretend to be a big boy.

Currently at $338.08 and Benzinga sets the target at $400.

Q3 2024 revenue of $1.2 billion, up 38.64% year-over-year.  Last 12 month revenue of $4.29 billion, a 41.48% increase year-over-year.  

Competitor Unity Software had Q3 2024 revenue of $446.52 million, down 17.95% year-over-year.  Unity Software’s last 12 months revenue at $1.97 billion, a 3.13% decrease year-over-year.

Q4 2024 financials will be presented on February 11, 2025.  

  
The company's core offerings can be divided into three main segments: Creative Agency, Software, and Apps.  
SparkLabs helps design and launch ads for mobile apps and games.  This includes playable ads, video ads, and ads on connected TVs.  This has helped some companies into the #1 spot in the App Store and Google Play Store.  AI has helped to generate ads as well, making the process more efficient - they claim it has saved 1600 hours of work.

Software makes up 56% of revenue. This includes AppDiscovery, which launched in 2023 and is an AI-powered tool to match advertisers with publishers.  ‘MAX’ takes an advertisers inventory and runs a real-time competitive auction to place ads in apps.  ‘Adjust’ is a SaaS for marketing companies to track stats, keeping them in the AppLovin network to see growth and drive them back for the next campaign.  These are all run on AppLovin’s AXON ML tool and App Graph for data collection/analysis.  

AppLovin has made over 350 free-to-play apps.  There is a gain for in-app purchases and ads, but also collects data to make their AI/ML tech even better.   

Their software has been part of multiple #1 apps, accelerated growth into global top 10 rankings, and helped increase installs.  This is across games from multiple publishers, shopping, media, finance, and health & fitness.  This includes Experian, DealDash, Enerjoy’s ShutEye app, SmartNews, and gaming studios like ABI Studio, Rollic, Say Games, and Azur Games.

Yeah. Since I am running a Monte Carlo simulation. I am only focusing on the bottom 5 percentile to 10 percentile return of this time period. Which seems to be automatically picking the worst possible months from that time period and extrapolating that to a 75 year period.


It is also picking inflation values which are closer to the 1 SD point away from the mean. Which is like 9.5% or something. If India experiences a inflation of 9.5% for several years then INR will depreciate against USD sufficiently that the effect of inflation will automatically be negated for me.



The bottom 5 percentile seems to be when the CAGR of my portfolio is 7.5%. Which is extremely conservative I feel.


I choose the bootstrap option when I ran the simulation.


Even if I see a 25th percentile return which was around 9.8% CAGR on my portifolio it I remember correctly. I will be golden. ","The plan that I have for my free time is to try build video games.

","Climate Change Investment Strategy

# Investment Thesis

This portfolio strategy aims to hedge some climate change risks by investing in sectors that will benefit to some extent from climate change. Thematically it's one of the most impactful changes across the next century for human civilization. I believe each year certain allocations will beat the market but overall I do not believe this will beat a S&P 500 ETF. To me this is a set it and forget it portfolio (my main portfolio is involved in high risk trading and I’m transferring some gains here then rebalancing with a slightly higher weighting on positions that are most undervalued). Some defensive sectors align with benefiting from climate change (utilities, consumer staples & defense tech) so this adds to the hedge component. Take from this what you will, overall I believe most people will benefit more from a market etf. Also feel free to roast this portfolio, I put this together in 2 hours, and still need to improve it quite a bit. 

The approach involves:

* Equal-weight allocation across ten key categories (around 10% each)
* Total portfolio allocation: 10% of total assets
* SPUU 13% as Performance Benchmark
* Investment horizon: 30+ years
* Strategy: Dollar-cost averaging profits into positions
* Focus: Major climate change impacts 

# Key Climate Change Drivers

* Increased global temperatures
* Increased utility energy demand
* Increased need for water technologies 
* Increased frequency and severity of fires
* Increased flooding and rising sea levels
* Increased infrastructure rebuilding and increased urban infrastructure
* Increased migration patterns
* Increased resource competition and potential conflicts 
* Increased need for agricultural inputs (ie fertilizer), increased agricultural production in Northern countries (Canada for example)
* Higher Inflationary environments, higher prices for materials
* Increased profits for insurance companies with higher pricing

They have growing business with China which may be impacted by US tariffs, but since this is a UK company and most EVs are sold in Europe and China anyways, I think this impact is minimal. I think EV growth might slow for a year or two, and some companies will have to move production to the US. Meanwhile, the US ramps up energy production so electricity gets relatively more affordable, making it reasonable to go electric, and when people remember how much more comfortable EVs are and are reminded that self driving cars is a thing - and is very close indeed, I think sales will pick back up pretty fast.

The growth of the Chinese middle class in urban areas has stagnated somewhat lately but is still growing. I think a global move away from the dollar and back to gold or alternative hard assets for BRICS countries will release China from the strains put on them by the US, triggering higher future growth of the middle class and thereby EV sales in china.

I live in Northern Europe rn, and any young person with money left on their mortgage after buying a home usually goes straight for an EV next despite increased electricity prices, so there is no stopping EV sales around these parts.

I mean seriously why would anyone want gold when all you can do is sell it for more and it's only been used as a store of value for like 6000 years or so.

Fiat is the only way to go because that's never failed throughout history. Well except with a 100% failure rate. But who's counting.

It's not like governments have never stolen their own citizens money before or froze their accounts.

What is the probability of US going into a period of stagflation given 1. US Sovereign Debt’s level and interest payment as % of GDP; 2. Trump’s tariff and potential government job cuts resulting in higher unemployment; 3. Supply shock if other countries imposes retaliatory sanctions and tariff against US.

And assuming the US economy might go into stagflation under Trump’s second term, what should people do with their asset allocation under this scenario? What types of asset generally perform well during stagflation? TIPS? Real Assets? Commodities?

During the 1970s, Equities’ returned less than inflation. Treasuries declined in real return terms too, although those with shorter-dated yields fared relatively better than their longer-dated counterparts. Precious metals tends to do well in stagflation but I am not sure now is the right time to buy gold given that its price is pretty elevated right now. Real assets like real estate and land require significant capital and debt financing, and is also quite illiquid.","What is the probability of US going into a period of stagflation given 1.

I do look at how stocks have performed over a 6-month, 1-year, 5-year period but I also give merit to how market sentiment factors in. Every sector has cycles so if I find a stock, sometimes by luck, that is on the verge of taking off then I may throw money into that. Sometimes it's not the hottest stock, like some AI and data center stocks are, but something that is tied to it like Vertiv (VRT). 

It's secondary and more under the radar but has great business practices and is a necessity to the development of that sector, which means there may be less manipulation of the stock. The less investors know about the stock, the likelihood the less shorts sellers are working against it. 

EMA can give you an indication of how a stock *may* perform but it isn't a golden nugget for me. Too many people rely on foundational stock advice but this market does not react and respond corollary to decades of tried-and-true investment advice. What made Buffett and others rich will not make the next investor rich. Those methods worked for them at that time. At this point in time, it's a little luck and a lot of conviction and patience.

“The Rise and Fall of a Millionaire”

From subreddit’s whispers, a plea for a loan,
To a throne of fortune you called your own.
A thousand turned to a million’s gleam,
A trader’s triumph, a fleeting dream.

Each trade was a step on a ladder of gold,
Risking it all, so daring, so bold.
Your account grew fast, a tale to tell,
A modern Icarus who flew too well.

But the market’s tides are cruel and swift,
Fortune’s favor is a fleeting gift.
One wrong move, and the wealth took flight,
Vanished like shadows in the dead of night.

A million lost, but remember this:
Your story’s not over—it’s far from abyss.
You climbed from nothing, with grit, with fire,
And proved the reach of unyielding desire.

So take a breath, the lessons are clear,
The road to riches can disappear.
But wealth’s not just in numbers you see,
It’s in the strength to start again—freely.

Hold your head high, for you’ll rise anew,
The one who made a million can make two.","“The Rise and Fall of a Millionaire”

2024-11-27,GLD,wallstreetbets,post,1h0razp,,,"I Believe J.P. Morgan Will Fail: An Analysis on Current Economic Conditions, First Republic, and the J Pow in Fed Minutes today","I Believe J.P. Morgan Will Fail: An Analysis on Current Economic Conditions, First Republic, and the J Pow in Fed Minutes today
Firstly, Jerome Powell gave a pretty rosy message of the economy and a soft landing today. Here's my favorite line:

*The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system and, on balance, continued to characterize the system’s financial vulnerabilities as notable.*

All this inspired by seeing JP Morgan's market cap at the 7th highest market cap in the U.S. and remembering a video seeing that the highest market cap companies before the great financial crisis were, you guessed it, banks and financial institutions. 

**1. First Republic’s Failure**  
First Republic Bank’s collapse last year was a wake-up call for the U.S. banking sector. The bank's reliance on wealthy depositors, who fled for higher-yielding alternatives as interest rates climbed, left it exposed to catastrophic liquidity pressures. By May 2023, the FDIC was forced to step in, marking one of the largest bank failures in U.S. history, with $229 billion in total assets at the time of its collapse.

J.P. Morgan Chase stepped in as the buyer, acquiring $92 billion in deposits, $173 billion in loans, and a chunk of First Republic’s securities portfolio. While the deal appeared to strengthen J.P. Morgan’s market dominance, it also saddled the bank with substantial risks. First Republic’s unrealized losses on long-term securities—estimated at over $13 billion—were now part of J.P. Morgan’s balance sheet, exposing it to the same vulnerabilities that triggered First Republic’s downfall.

**2. What Did J.P. Morgan Gain?**  
The First Republic acquisition allowed J.P. Morgan to absorb a considerable portion of the failing bank’s assets:

* **Deposits:** $92 billion in additional deposits brought J.P. Morgan’s total deposit base to over $2.4 trillion as of Q2 2024.
* **Revenue Boost:** The new deposits and loans contributed to J.P. Morgan’s record-setting $4.7 billion in net income from consumer and community banking in Q3 2024.
* **Market Power:** The acquisition expanded J.P. Morgan’s dominance in the high-net-worth banking sector, positioning it as the undisputed leader in U.S. banking.

But these gains came with baggage. First Republic’s unrealized losses, stemming from long-duration assets devalued by rising rates, added significant balance sheet risk. J.P. Morgan’s exposure to long-term securities now surpasses $600 billion, a large portion of which remains vulnerable to further rate hikes.

**3. Why Unrealized Losses Do Matter**  
Banks like to dismiss unrealized losses as “paper losses,” but in reality, they have serious implications for liquidity and stability:

* **Collateral Impact:** Unrealized losses reduce the market value of assets used as collateral. J.P. Morgan’s loan-to-deposit ratio, already at 68% in Q3 2024, is under pressure as collateral value shrinks.
* **Liquidity Crunch Risk:** If depositors withdraw funds at scale—similar to First Republic’s depositor flight—J.P. Morgan would be forced to sell these securities at a loss. U.S. banks collectively hold $558 billion in unrealized losses, and J.P. Morgan’s share is among the largest.
* **Stress Test Weakness:** Even as J.P. Morgan clears regulatory stress tests, the lingering unrealized losses strain its ability to pivot in a crisis.

Unrealized losses also contribute to a “tightening effect,” where banks restrict lending to avoid further balance sheet risks. This contraction reduces profitability and impacts the broader economy.

**4. How Interest Rates Uniquely Affect J.P. Morgan and Other Banks**  
Interest rates are hammering J.P. Morgan across multiple lines of business:

* **Mortgages:** With 30-year fixed mortgage rates above **7.5%**, home sales are collapsing. New mortgage originations fell **31% year-over-year** in Q3 2024, gutting J.P. Morgan’s consumer lending revenues.
* **Lending Defaults:** Rising rates are increasing delinquencies. Credit card delinquencies are at **3.36%**, the highest since 2013, and auto loan delinquencies have surged to **6.1%**.
* **Financial Products:** The higher rates have slashed the market value of J.P. Morgan’s long-term securities portfolio, compounding unrealized losses.

For every 1% increase in interest rates, J.P. Morgan’s portfolio faces an estimated **$2 billion to $4 billion** in additional unrealized losses. While higher rates boost short-term loan yields, the broader impact of slowing lending activity and rising defaults far outweighs the gains.

**5. The Tightrope the Fed Is Walking**  
The Federal Reserve isn’t just balancing inflation and economic growth—it’s also trying to avoid systemic banking failures. But for J.P. Morgan, both high and low rate environments are dangerous:

* **High Rates:** They crush consumer spending, send delinquencies soaring, and depress home sales. For J.P. Morgan, this means rising loan losses and reduced activity in its mortgage and consumer lending businesses.
* **Low Rates:** While lower rates could stabilize borrowers, they thin J.P. Morgan’s net interest margin, which accounted for **$22 billion in revenue** in Q3 2024 alone. Unrealized losses also remain locked in if rates drop too slowly.

The Fed’s current target rate of **5.25% to 5.50%** is already exposing banks to these pressures. Any misstep in monetary policy could push institutions like J.P. Morgan over the edge.

**6. The Risks: Deteriorating Economic Conditions in Housing, Lending, and Labor**  
Economic conditions are deteriorating on multiple fronts:

* **Housing Market Decline:** The average home sales price has fallen **4.5%** from its peak, with further declines likely as mortgage rates remain elevated. This mirrors the early stages of the 2008 housing crisis.
* **Credit Card Debt:** U.S. consumers are drowning in debt, with balances hitting a record **$1.17 trillion** in Q3 2024. Delinquencies are rising, and banks like J.P. Morgan are struggling to balance high APRs with borrower defaults.
* **Labor Market Weakness:** The unemployment rate has risen to **3.9%**, with layoffs increasing in high-paying sectors like tech and finance. Rising job losses mean more loan defaults, compounding stress on banks’ balance sheets.

J.P. Morgan’s exposure to these risks spans its entire portfolio, from consumer credit to housing and business lending.

**7. Why J.P. Morgan Will Not Make It Through These Trends Unscathed**  
J.P. Morgan’s position feels eerily similar to Goldman Sachs in 2008—record profits masking systemic weaknesses:

* **High Credit Card Rates:** They’re keeping APRs at record levels, but delinquencies are climbing, and borrowers are maxing out, limiting future lending potential.
* **Falling Home Equity:** Home price declines are cutting into consumer collateral, reducing refinancing activity and squeezing spending.
* **Investment Banking Decline:** IPO activity is down **47% year-over-year**, as private funding dominates. This cuts into J.P. Morgan’s fee revenue, a crucial profit center.

To sustain profitability, J.P. Morgan may increasingly turn to complex financial products like **Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs)**. These instruments, similar to the CDOs that helped crash the economy in 2008, package risky corporate loans for speculative investment. If defaults rise—and signs already point to this—these instruments could implode, taking significant portions of J.P. Morgan’s balance sheet with them.

Also it's J. P. Morgan's concentration high net worth clients in conjunction with its acquisition of First Republic that may have been a Trojan Horse. The clients at First Republic have likely or will split their accounts up so to not have to deal with the risk or stress of reclaiming their assets, and other clients at J.P. Morgan might even stop to think, hmm why would I risk that too? The limit is like around 6 ish different accounts at the same bank for FDIC coverage, the JPM high-net worth clients require $10million+. If you have any financial awareness you will see these trends and risks too with concentrating your assets and you will move your money as needed. 

This isn't going to end well for some of these companies, J.P. Morgan is just one of them. Bank of America is at high risk, and so are so many other banks too. It was fine when everyone had their stimulus checks and when other banks could step in to acquire assets. But who the hell is going to acquire assets from the big boys? Maybe thats why Buffett is in full cash right now. The risks to the financial system are substantial, and the American people will probably be left holding the bag again...","Firstly, Jerome Powell gave a pretty rosy message of the economy and a soft landing today.

Suffice to say, I' tend to think that the magic seed of hate is a result of the gutsy bet against the British pound. While it may have made Soros a legend on the Street, he became an overnight villain for breaking the pound on Black Wednesday. it's safe to assume the Tories and many regular britons were fuming as it tanked John Major's PM seat and cost the Tories big and literally cost the country even more. Unemployment skyrocketed as a result and, if I remember right, their were riots in the aftermath. Without going into it too much it completely transformed British economic policy going forward and had reverberations throughout Europe.

And didn't have to invest much in R&D because what's the point. 20 years ago you would have needed to know WHICH of the 20 HDD manufacturers will be the last standing

- IBM will be a minnow in 20 years until a miracle occurs, the cloud passed them by. Now they are cashing out instead of investing in a future similar to Seagate. If you think that selling the table silver will continue another 20 years ... 

- insurers will have a hard time staying profitable if interest rates continue to stay normal. Most of their huge consistent profits came from 40 years of falling interest rates to 0. You can't get lower than 0 that ship has sailed. The same is true for a lot of other companies on the list by the way. Even ibm increased ever cheaper debt pumping up profits. I am sure the same is true of others.

- natural gas and energy  is at best questionable, even if fossile fuel will be with us for long most proven reserves are owned by state companies like Aramco. Fracking blew up but that is dangerous politically and the reserves don't hold forever since they need to be replenished.

These are just 4 examples of company types and behaviors that can boost profits for a LONG time but well are eventually unsustainable.  And you need sustainability over many decades.

They may be on this list in 20 years. But at that point it may be too late investing in them. 

Basically my point is
- handpicked lists of companies are almost always useless esp. If someone just filters on some metrics
- past performance is almost always uncorrelates to future performance.  On a comparable time span.

Just invest in the sp500 and if you want more stability putting parts of it in something more stable like treasuries,  gold , etc. Is most likely a good idea.

Yes, in a nuclear apocalypse or complete collapse of society gold probably won’t do you much good. You’ll want food, water, iodine, guns, bullets, etc. 

But that’s not the only thing that can happen. 

Maybe the it’s just a complete stock market crash as economic stagnation wrecks the US. Maybe the banks holding your non-physical gold goes bust. 


Maybe the US dollar loses economic dominance and faces hyper inflation. 


Maybe there is a civil war and shit is bad and the United States dissolves into multiple countries, but commodities and trading still exist, but your banks accounts with national FDIC insured banks are useless. 


Maybe fascism wins and you become a target and need to flee but your bank accounts are frozen. 



Etc etc etc. 


There are plenty of scenarios where physical gold is useful. Most of them very unlikely, but people act like societal collapse is all or nothing. 


If you are Jewish in 1920 Weimar Germany, physical gold would be a lot better than Paiermarks. You avoid the hyper inflation of the next couple years and in a decade when you need to flee the country it’s a lot easier to flee with gold than cash. 




Personally I think most scenarios are unlikely enough to not be worth the hassle of physical gold but I’m not gonna pretend it’s absurd to think it could be useful","There are different levels of catastrophe.

Land and its use, businesses with productivity, and employees are productive assets.

Anything related to resource values (gold, silver, copper, etc) is inherently reliant on other stock holders and the inherent risk that a large mine of new deposits are discovered.
Land, even with minimal use of productivity, can become a positive asset due to the fact that we cannot discover new land; all land on this earth is discovered. But if we found something wrong with it (ex: massive flood zone, significant radon, or in an area hit by abrupt destructive weather), or if it becomes less desirable relative to its immediate surroundings, it’s going downhill in value.

Productive assets, like farm land and business investment, is always the best option.

Crypto has no underlying value aside from people’s opinion and interest. It’s gambling. It’s the consensus of “I think if I buy it now, others will want to buy it at a higher price at X time in the future. But there are no metrics to assess its value other than people’s interest. I can buy shares of a company after looking at their financial disclosures in order to determine if it’s a worthwhile risk. I cannot do that with a non-productive asset like crypto.

The only value they bring to me, is knowing that someone else will want it more than me down the road and is willing to pay a higher price. Thus, when I’m ready to cash it in, the market will have caused the price to go up.

One can argue that stocks are more useful because they are literal shares of a productive company. But to me, that doesn’t change anything. The shares are already issued, the company has already made money, and the equity is just being traded between individuals via broker. Just like how crypto are just chunks of currency belonging to a blockchain being traded between individuals via an exchange. 

“But you’re investing in a company”

No I’m not. The company received the money for fundraising when they release the initial shares to whoever bought them. Once they’re resold and traded on the public market, it’s purely between secondary individuals via broker. And, if one company stock gives me 10% a year while another does 25% in a quarter? Best believe I’m dumping the first one to obtain the second one.

My point is: yes, I do think it’s kinda a Ponzi scheme. But almost everything is. It’s all depending on if someone will buy it from me (stocks, crypto, gold, house) more than I bought it for.","Do you invest in stocks? It’s the same thing. I own the big names and the typical ETFs. The only value they bring to me, is knowing that someone else will want it more than me down the road and is willing to pay a higher price. Thus, when I’m ready to cash it in, the market will have caused the price to go up.

One can argue that stocks are more useful because they are literal shares of a productive company. But to me, that doesn’t change anything. The shares are already issued, the company has already made money, and the equity is just being traded between individuals via broker. Just like how crypto are just chunks of currency belonging to a blockchain being traded between individuals via an exchange. 

“But you’re investing in a company”

No I’m not. The company received the money for fundraising when they release the initial shares to whoever bought them. Once they’re resold and traded on the public market, it’s purely between secondary individuals via broker. And, if one company stock gives me 10% a year while another does 25% in a quarter? Best believe I’m dumping the first one to obtain the second one.

Hi All,

First post here and sorry if this is not the right sub for investments other than stock market.

A friend of a friend is building a small hotel/tiny resort (10-15 rooms/small houses) with a pool and activities in and around rural Crete, Greece and is open to investors. 

I’m from one of the APAC countries and am interested in investing in it ($100k-500k) but not what investment options should I consider. 

I’m not interested in Visa (Golden Visa) or right to live in Greece, I just want to own something in a European country, something I can pass onto my children. 

Questions: 

1. What are the typical investment options when investing in small hotels? (Owning shares, % of revenue/profit, owning right to holiday whenever, timeshare etc what am I missing?)

2. Is anyone aware of any regulations or requirements for anyone from APAC investing in European Economic Zone?

3. Do you think it’s a good idea? Yes, why? No, why? 

Thank you so much!","Hi All,

Just some food for thought and maybe I can get some opinions. I think that way too many people chase investment goals or delayed gratification in the sense that when they are 65, they will have lavish spending in their golden years. Way too many people develop debilitating health issues (heart failure, COPD, etc) die in a freak accident, get lung/brain/skin/spinal cancer, etc. On the other hand, investing gives some sense of peace of mind, a hope that by the time you reach old age or FIRE, you will be comfortable and no longer have to work. Life is pretty fragile so in my view, people shouldn’t be investing large percentages of their income and focus living on today. Fill your days with life rather than fill your life with days. Spend money on experiences and with those you love because that’s what really matters.. Im not saying don’t invest, but be intentional about how much you invest. My grandfather rapidly developed parkinsons+ and passed away a few years after his 60th birthday, my grandma saved up millions but never spent it and now is at end stage alzheimers. Ive also known a couple people in their 30’s that died in freak accidents. Im in my late twenties and have about a quarter million in my portfolio but I intend on cutting back weekly investments to near 0.. spending more on experiences and stuff like that.

1. Introduction: The Evolution of Data, the Dawn of Palantir

For centuries, empires were built on tangible resources—gold, oil, and steel. But as the world becomes increasingly digital, there’s a new resource powering global economies: data. Unlike oil, data doesn’t deplete; it grows exponentially, compounding its value the more it’s used. But here’s the rub: most of this data is noise—unstructured, chaotic, and ultimately useless.

Enter Palantir Technologies.

Palantir isn’t just another Silicon Valley SaaS company. It’s the data refinery of the modern age, transforming raw, unfiltered information into actionable intelligence. Whether it’s optimizing global supply chains, tracking terrorists, or helping Fortune 500 companies save billions, Palantir has become the central nervous system for decision-making at the highest levels.

  


2. Palantir’s Origin Story: CIA-Backed and Built for Chaos

Most tech companies start in a garage with a dream. Palantir started in a war room with the CIA. Founded in 2003 by Peter Thiel, Alex Karp, and a team of engineers who probably sleep in Faraday cages, Palantir’s initial mission was simple: stop terrorism by harnessing the power of data.

Using seed money from In-Q-Tel (the CIA’s venture capital arm), Palantir developed Gotham, a platform so advanced it could identify patterns terrorists didn’t even know they were following. The result? Major wins in counter-terrorism, and a new reputation as the go-to software for solving problems too complex for the human brain.

But Palantir didn’t stop there. It expanded beyond the battlefield, bringing its data-crunching prowess to the commercial sector. From agriculture to healthcare to space exploration, Palantir is now involved in nearly every major industry.

  


3. Gotham and Foundry: The Dual Engines of Global Domination

Palantir’s secret sauce lies in its two flagship platforms: Gotham and Foundry.

Gotham: The Brain of the Intelligence Community

Gotham is essentially the Swiss Army knife of military-grade data analytics. It’s used by defense agencies, intelligence operations, and law enforcement to:

* Track insurgents in real-time.
* Analyze satellite imagery for strategic planning.
* Predict supply chain bottlenecks during wartime.

The beauty of Gotham is its adaptability. Whether you’re chasing down smugglers in the South China Sea or coordinating disaster relief in Haiti, Gotham turns chaos into clarity.

Foundry: The Commercial Juggernaut

Foundry, on the other hand, is Palantir’s platform for the private sector. Think of it as Gotham’s slightly less classified sibling, built to optimize corporate operations.

* Healthcare: Foundry was instrumental in vaccine distribution during COVID-19, helping governments allocate doses with pinpoint accuracy.
* Manufacturing: It predicts equipment failures before they happen, saving companies millions in downtime.
* Retail: Foundry optimizes inventory and supply chains so efficiently that you’re probably eating fresher chicken because of it.

Together, Gotham and Foundry form an unstoppable duo, enabling Palantir to operate at the intersection of public and private interests.

  


4. Why Data Is the New Oil (And Palantir Owns the Refineries)

We’ve all heard the cliché: “Data is the new oil.” But let’s unpack what that really means.

Oil is only valuable once it’s extracted, refined, and distributed. Similarly, data is only valuable once it’s collected, analyzed, and applied. Most companies are drowning in data they don’t understand. Palantir offers them a lifeboat—and charges them handsomely for it.

The Data Refinery Model

Palantir doesn’t just clean and analyze data; it turns it into a strategic weapon. By integrating disparate data sources, identifying patterns, and automating decision-making, Palantir provides insights no competitor can match.

  


5. The AI Revolution: Why Palantir Is Already in the Future

While the world gushes over OpenAI and Google Bard, Palantir is quietly operating on a different level. Its AI models don’t just generate text or images—they make decisions.

For example:

* Defense: Palantir’s AI predicts insurgent movements and suggests optimal countermeasures.
* Supply Chains: It forecasts disruptions weeks in advance, allowing companies to adapt proactively.
* Healthcare: It identifies high-risk patients before symptoms escalate, saving lives and reducing costs.

In a world obsessed with AI hype, Palantir is delivering real-world impact.

  


6. Palantir’s Government Contracts: The Unbreakable Moat

Government contracts are Palantir’s bread and butter, and critics often see this as a weakness. They couldn’t be more wrong.

Governments are the ultimate ""sticky"" customer. They don’t switch providers just because someone else offers a cheaper price—they prioritize reliability, security, and expertise. Palantir’s deep integration into agencies like the Department of Defense and the CIA creates a moat no competitor can penetrate.

  


7. The Commercial Growth Curve: From Chickens to Space Rockets

Palantir’s expansion into the commercial sector is where the real growth lies. In industries ranging from agriculture to aerospace, Palantir is becoming indispensable.

* Agriculture: Foundry helps optimize crop yields and reduce waste.
* Aerospace: SpaceX and Boeing are reportedly exploring Palantir’s capabilities for space logistics.
* Automotive: Palantir is working with automakers to develop smarter, more efficient supply chains.

  


8. Total Addressable Market (TAM): $19 Trillion Reasons Why $PLTR Is Cheap

The global data economy is projected to hit $19 trillion by 2030. Palantir doesn’t need to dominate this market—it only needs a slice. Even capturing 1% of the TAM translates to $190 billion in annual revenue, making its current $40 billion valuation laughably low.

  


9. The Flywheel Effect: Why Palantir Can’t Be Stopped

Every new client Palantir lands generates more data, which improves its algorithms, making its platforms even more valuable. This compounding flywheel effect creates exponential growth.

  


10. Competitive Moats: Crushing Microsoft, Google, and Anyone Else Foolish Enough to Try

Unlike competitors, Palantir operates at the nexus of AI, data, and decision-making. Its platforms aren’t just tools; they’re ecosystems that clients can’t live without.

  


11. Risks? What Risks?

Critics will point to competition, valuation, or reliance on government contracts. But let’s be real:

* Palantir’s tech is years ahead of its competitors.
* Valuation concerns are irrelevant in the face of exponential growth.
* Government reliance is a strength, not a weakness.

  


12. Valuation Framework: How $PLTR Gets to a $3 Trillion Market Cap

At 50x sales, Palantir’s potential $190 billion revenue by 2030 would translate to a $9.5 trillion market cap. Even using a conservative 15x multiple, $PLTR easily hits $3 trillion.

  


13. TL;DR: The Endgame

Palantir isn’t just a company; it’s a force of nature. As data becomes the world’s most valuable resource, Palantir is poised to become the refinery, the pipeline, and the marketplace.

Don’t overthink it. Buy $PLTR, hold it, and thank me later. 🚀

  




Appendices

Appendix A: The Palantir Paradigm in Action: A Case Study in Innovation

A1: The Chicken Supply Chain (You Can’t Make This Stuff Up)

Let’s talk about the future of poultry (yes, really). Palantir isn’t just helping defense agencies track terrorists—it’s tracking chickens, too. The company has pioneered Farm Foundry, an initiative that partners with major agricultural firms to optimize supply chains by using machine learning and real-time data analytics. This goes beyond reducing waste—it’s predicting the chicken’s next move.

In a market where one sick chicken could bring down an entire supply chain, Palantir’s AI infrastructure ensures that every bird is accounted for. So when you think about your next fried chicken sandwich, just remember: Palantir is making it taste better. (Take that, factory farms).

A2: The Rocket-Powered Flywheel

Speaking of aerospace, Palantir’s role in SpaceX’s Starship project is underreported. How? Because Palantir is the secret sauce that’s making sure Elon’s interplanetary dreams don’t come crashing down. By streamlining everything from logistics to fuel efficiency through Foundry, SpaceX has reduced rocket prep time and optimized launch strategies.

The flywheel? Every launch feeds data back into Palantir’s system, which then optimizes future missions. They’re literally using AI to launch rockets and improve their chances of not blowing up. Big deal.

  


Appendix B: The Data Wars: Palantir vs. The World (The Battle of Wits)

B1: Microsoft’s Power BI vs. Palantir’s Foundry

Some armchair analysts like to say Microsoft’s Power BI can do everything Palantir can, but they’re missing the point. Power BI is great for basic reporting and visualizing data for someone who thinks dashboards are exciting. But Palantir isn’t about dashboards—it’s about decision-making at the highest levels of government and industry.

The difference?

* Power BI is a tool to manage data.
* Palantir is a system to transform data into decisions.

While Microsoft is busy putting up graphs, Palantir is helping the U.S. military predict the next battle move in the war for data supremacy.

B2: Google’s AI vs. Palantir’s Predictive Intelligence

Another favorite target for comparison is Google’s AI. The thing is, Google’s AI is all about convenience. From reading your emails to recommending cat videos, it’s a consumer-driven model. Palantir? Palantir’s AI is for decision-makers who literally save lives or spend billions of dollars optimizing entire economies.

Palantir’s predictive algorithms go far beyond just AI that answers queries; they’re shaping military strategies, guiding healthcare protocols, and preventing global supply chain disasters from happening. So, yeah, while Google AI helps you find the best pizza joint, Palantir’s AI is helping you win wars and save nations. Checkmate.

  


Appendix C: Palantir's Economic Moat: The Super Secure, Unbreakable Wall

C1: The Contract Moat: Why No One Else Can Touch Palantir

Palantir’s contracts with government agencies are the ultimate security blanket. While critics point to government dependence as a risk, we know better. Government contracts aren’t just sticky—they’re cemented in place by the iron hand of national security.

The fact is, no one—not even Microsoft, not Google, and certainly not the handful of startup data-mining firms—can even touch Palantir when it comes to securing and analyzing government data. You know why? Because they have proprietary algorithms that literally the CIA and FBI depend on for national security.

That’s a moat so deep, you’d need a boat, a jet ski, and a small army of cyborgs to even dream of crossing it.

C2: The Data Flywheel: The AI Brain That Powers Everything

Once Palantir enters a new sector, the data flywheel kicks in. Each new client generates data that powers new algorithms, which in turn optimize future processes for all clients.

For example, when Palantir works with a new healthcare provider, their AI learns and improves its predictions, helping that client reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. But the true genius? The AI doesn’t stop learning. It uses that new data to improve its models for every other client, creating an unbreakable loop of value creation.

  


Appendix D: The Thesis of the Future: Palantir and the $19 Trillion Data Economy

D1: The $19 Trillion Thesis: Data’s GDP Growth is Rocket Fuel

As noted in Section 8, the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for Palantir is projected to hit $19 trillion by 2030. But what does that actually mean?

Let’s break it down. The data economy isn’t just about selling customer insights or optimizing advertising algorithms. It’s the entire global economy running on data-driven decisions.

Every business, every government, every organization will rely on data analytics to predict the future. Think about that for a second: you are not just optimizing marketing strategies or sales pipelines; you are literally reshaping the future of civilization.

The $19 trillion TAM is Palantir’s to conquer. With its unparalleled infrastructure, constant AI refinement, and the ability to work in any industry, Palantir is poised to capture not just a slice—but the entire pie.

  


Appendix E: Palantir and the Blockchain: The Next Great Convergence

Okay, bear with me on this one, because we’re going full ""Blockchain conspiracy theorist"" here. Palantir’s data platforms aren’t just limited to traditional methods.

Palantir has already explored blockchain technologies to secure data exchanges, improve transparency in financial transactions, and even combat fraud in sectors like real estate and logistics.

Imagine a world where every single transaction—from a defense contract to your Amazon order—can be traced on an immutable ledger, analyzed by Palantir’s algorithms, and optimized in real time.

Blockchain isn’t just a buzzword for Palantir—it’s the next great tool in reshaping how humanity operates. And Palantir will be leading that charge, as usual.

  


Appendix F: The Palantir Business Model: Why It’s a Profit Machine

Let’s do the math for a second. Palantir’s annual revenue growth isn’t just linear—it’s exponential. Why? Because once a company gets hooked on Foundry or Gotham, it’s almost impossible to unsubscribe.

1. Introduction: The Evolution of Data, the Dawn of Palantir

For centuries, empires were built on tangible resources—gold, oil, and steel. But as the world becomes increasingly digital, there’s a new resource powering global economies: data. Unlike oil, data doesn’t deplete; it grows exponentially, compounding its value the more it’s used. But here’s the rub: most of this data is noise—unstructured, chaotic, and ultimately useless.

Enter Palantir Technologies.

Palantir isn’t just another Silicon Valley SaaS company. It’s the data refinery of the modern age, transforming raw, unfiltered information into actionable intelligence. Whether it’s optimizing global supply chains, tracking terrorists, or helping Fortune 500 companies save billions, Palantir has become the central nervous system for decision-making at the highest levels.

  


2. Palantir’s Origin Story: CIA-Backed and Built for Chaos

Most tech companies start in a garage with a dream. Palantir started in a war room with the CIA. Founded in 2003 by Peter Thiel, Alex Karp, and a team of engineers who probably sleep in Faraday cages, Palantir’s initial mission was simple: stop terrorism by harnessing the power of data.

Using seed money from In-Q-Tel (the CIA’s venture capital arm), Palantir developed Gotham, a platform so advanced it could identify patterns terrorists didn’t even know they were following. The result? Major wins in counter-terrorism, and a new reputation as the go-to software for solving problems too complex for the human brain.

But Palantir didn’t stop there. It expanded beyond the battlefield, bringing its data-crunching prowess to the commercial sector. From agriculture to healthcare to space exploration, Palantir is now involved in nearly every major industry.

  


3. Gotham and Foundry: The Dual Engines of Global Domination

Palantir’s secret sauce lies in its two flagship platforms: Gotham and Foundry.

Gotham: The Brain of the Intelligence Community

Gotham is essentially the Swiss Army knife of military-grade data analytics. It’s used by defense agencies, intelligence operations, and law enforcement to:

* Track insurgents in real-time.
* Analyze satellite imagery for strategic planning.
* Predict supply chain bottlenecks during wartime.

The beauty of Gotham is its adaptability. Whether you’re chasing down smugglers in the South China Sea or coordinating disaster relief in Haiti, Gotham turns chaos into clarity.

Foundry: The Commercial Juggernaut

Foundry, on the other hand, is Palantir’s platform for the private sector. Think of it as Gotham’s slightly less classified sibling, built to optimize corporate operations.

* Healthcare: Foundry was instrumental in vaccine distribution during COVID-19, helping governments allocate doses with pinpoint accuracy.
* Manufacturing: It predicts equipment failures before they happen, saving companies millions in downtime.
* Retail: Foundry optimizes inventory and supply chains so efficiently that you’re probably eating fresher chicken because of it.

Together, Gotham and Foundry form an unstoppable duo, enabling Palantir to operate at the intersection of public and private interests.

  


4. Why Data Is the New Oil (And Palantir Owns the Refineries)

We’ve all heard the cliché: “Data is the new oil.” But let’s unpack what that really means.

Oil is only valuable once it’s extracted, refined, and distributed. Similarly, data is only valuable once it’s collected, analyzed, and applied. Most companies are drowning in data they don’t understand. Palantir offers them a lifeboat—and charges them handsomely for it.

The Data Refinery Model

Palantir doesn’t just clean and analyze data; it turns it into a strategic weapon. By integrating disparate data sources, identifying patterns, and automating decision-making, Palantir provides insights no competitor can match.

  


5. The AI Revolution: Why Palantir Is Already in the Future

While the world gushes over OpenAI and Google Bard, Palantir is quietly operating on a different level. Its AI models don’t just generate text or images—they make decisions.

For example:

* Defense: Palantir’s AI predicts insurgent movements and suggests optimal countermeasures.
* Supply Chains: It forecasts disruptions weeks in advance, allowing companies to adapt proactively.
* Healthcare: It identifies high-risk patients before symptoms escalate, saving lives and reducing costs.

In a world obsessed with AI hype, Palantir is delivering real-world impact.

  


6. Palantir’s Government Contracts: The Unbreakable Moat

Government contracts are Palantir’s bread and butter, and critics often see this as a weakness. They couldn’t be more wrong.

Governments are the ultimate ""sticky"" customer. They don’t switch providers just because someone else offers a cheaper price—they prioritize reliability, security, and expertise. Palantir’s deep integration into agencies like the Department of Defense and the CIA creates a moat no competitor can penetrate.

  


7. The Commercial Growth Curve: From Chickens to Space Rockets

Palantir’s expansion into the commercial sector is where the real growth lies. In industries ranging from agriculture to aerospace, Palantir is becoming indispensable.

* Agriculture: Foundry helps optimize crop yields and reduce waste.
* Aerospace: SpaceX and Boeing are reportedly exploring Palantir’s capabilities for space logistics.
* Automotive: Palantir is working with automakers to develop smarter, more efficient supply chains.

  


8. Total Addressable Market (TAM): $19 Trillion Reasons Why $PLTR Is Cheap

The global data economy is projected to hit $19 trillion by 2030. Palantir doesn’t need to dominate this market—it only needs a slice. Even capturing 1% of the TAM translates to $190 billion in annual revenue, making its current $40 billion valuation laughably low.

  


9. The Flywheel Effect: Why Palantir Can’t Be Stopped

Every new client Palantir lands generates more data, which improves its algorithms, making its platforms even more valuable. This compounding flywheel effect creates exponential growth.

  


10. Competitive Moats: Crushing Microsoft, Google, and Anyone Else Foolish Enough to Try

Unlike competitors, Palantir operates at the nexus of AI, data, and decision-making. Its platforms aren’t just tools; they’re ecosystems that clients can’t live without.

  


11. Risks? What Risks?

Critics will point to competition, valuation, or reliance on government contracts. But let’s be real:

* Palantir’s tech is years ahead of its competitors.
* Valuation concerns are irrelevant in the face of exponential growth.
* Government reliance is a strength, not a weakness.

  


12. Valuation Framework: How $PLTR Gets to a $3 Trillion Market Cap

At 50x sales, Palantir’s potential $190 billion revenue by 2030 would translate to a $9.5 trillion market cap. Even using a conservative 15x multiple, $PLTR easily hits $3 trillion.

  


13. TL;DR: The Endgame

Palantir isn’t just a company; it’s a force of nature. As data becomes the world’s most valuable resource, Palantir is poised to become the refinery, the pipeline, and the marketplace.

Don’t overthink it. Buy $PLTR, hold it, and thank me later. 🚀

  




Appendices

Appendix A: The Palantir Paradigm in Action: A Case Study in Innovation

A1: The Chicken Supply Chain (You Can’t Make This Stuff Up)

Let’s talk about the future of poultry (yes, really). Palantir isn’t just helping defense agencies track terrorists—it’s tracking chickens, too. The company has pioneered Farm Foundry, an initiative that partners with major agricultural firms to optimize supply chains by using machine learning and real-time data analytics. This goes beyond reducing waste—it’s predicting the chicken’s next move.

In a market where one sick chicken could bring down an entire supply chain, Palantir’s AI infrastructure ensures that every bird is accounted for. So when you think about your next fried chicken sandwich, just remember: Palantir is making it taste better. (Take that, factory farms).

A2: The Rocket-Powered Flywheel

Speaking of aerospace, Palantir’s role in SpaceX’s Starship project is underreported. How? Because Palantir is the secret sauce that’s making sure Elon’s interplanetary dreams don’t come crashing down. By streamlining everything from logistics to fuel efficiency through Foundry, SpaceX has reduced rocket prep time and optimized launch strategies.

The flywheel? Every launch feeds data back into Palantir’s system, which then optimizes future missions. They’re literally using AI to launch rockets and improve their chances of not blowing up. Big deal.

  


Appendix B: The Data Wars: Palantir vs. The World (The Battle of Wits)

B1: Microsoft’s Power BI vs. Palantir’s Foundry

Some armchair analysts like to say Microsoft’s Power BI can do everything Palantir can, but they’re missing the point. Power BI is great for basic reporting and visualizing data for someone who thinks dashboards are exciting. But Palantir isn’t about dashboards—it’s about decision-making at the highest levels of government and industry.

The difference?

* Power BI is a tool to manage data.
* Palantir is a system to transform data into decisions.

While Microsoft is busy putting up graphs, Palantir is helping the U.S. military predict the next battle move in the war for data supremacy.

B2: Google’s AI vs. Palantir’s Predictive Intelligence

Another favorite target for comparison is Google’s AI. The thing is, Google’s AI is all about convenience. From reading your emails to recommending cat videos, it’s a consumer-driven model. Palantir? Palantir’s AI is for decision-makers who literally save lives or spend billions of dollars optimizing entire economies.

Palantir’s predictive algorithms go far beyond just AI that answers queries; they’re shaping military strategies, guiding healthcare protocols, and preventing global supply chain disasters from happening. So, yeah, while Google AI helps you find the best pizza joint, Palantir’s AI is helping you win wars and save nations. Checkmate.

  


Appendix C: Palantir's Economic Moat: The Super Secure, Unbreakable Wall

C1: The Contract Moat: Why No One Else Can Touch Palantir

Palantir’s contracts with government agencies are the ultimate security blanket. While critics point to government dependence as a risk, we know better. Government contracts aren’t just sticky—they’re cemented in place by the iron hand of national security.

The fact is, no one—not even Microsoft, not Google, and certainly not the handful of startup data-mining firms—can even touch Palantir when it comes to securing and analyzing government data. You know why? Because they have proprietary algorithms that literally the CIA and FBI depend on for national security.

That’s a moat so deep, you’d need a boat, a jet ski, and a small army of cyborgs to even dream of crossing it.

C2: The Data Flywheel: The AI Brain That Powers Everything

Once Palantir enters a new sector, the data flywheel kicks in. Each new client generates data that powers new algorithms, which in turn optimize future processes for all clients.

For example, when Palantir works with a new healthcare provider, their AI learns and improves its predictions, helping that client reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. But the true genius? The AI doesn’t stop learning. It uses that new data to improve its models for every other client, creating an unbreakable loop of value creation.

  


Appendix D: The Thesis of the Future: Palantir and the $19 Trillion Data Economy

D1: The $19 Trillion Thesis: Data’s GDP Growth is Rocket Fuel

As noted in Section 8, the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for Palantir is projected to hit $19 trillion by 2030. But what does that actually mean?

Let’s break it down. The data economy isn’t just about selling customer insights or optimizing advertising algorithms. It’s the entire global economy running on data-driven decisions.

Every business, every government, every organization will rely on data analytics to predict the future. Think about that for a second: you are not just optimizing marketing strategies or sales pipelines; you are literally reshaping the future of civilization.

The $19 trillion TAM is Palantir’s to conquer. With its unparalleled infrastructure, constant AI refinement, and the ability to work in any industry, Palantir is poised to capture not just a slice—but the entire pie.

  


Appendix E: Palantir and the Blockchain: The Next Great Convergence

Okay, bear with me on this one, because we’re going full ""Blockchain conspiracy theorist"" here. Palantir’s data platforms aren’t just limited to traditional methods.

Palantir has already explored blockchain technologies to secure data exchanges, improve transparency in financial transactions, and even combat fraud in sectors like real estate and logistics.

Imagine a world where every single transaction—from a defense contract to your Amazon order—can be traced on an immutable ledger, analyzed by Palantir’s algorithms, and optimized in real time.

Blockchain isn’t just a buzzword for Palantir—it’s the next great tool in reshaping how humanity operates. And Palantir will be leading that charge, as usual.

  


Appendix F: The Palantir Business Model: Why It’s a Profit Machine

Let’s do the math for a second. Palantir’s annual revenue growth isn’t just linear—it’s exponential. Why? Because once a company gets hooked on Foundry or Gotham, it’s almost impossible to unsubscribe.

Unlike other SaaS platforms that face churn rates, Palantir’s clients need them for life. That’s high-margin, recurring revenue. Think about it: Palantir isn’t just another vendor. It’s the brains behind every major decision at top-tier companies and governments. They’re not leaving anytime soon.

The ""sticky"" factor for Palantir’s customers is infinite. You get addicted to the platform, and then, you never look back.They’re the Elon Musk of the data world. People won’t just trust them—they’ll worship them.



Appendix G: Palantir’s Competitive Advantage: How It Crushes the Competition

While the competition focuses on basic analytics and data mining, Palantir goes above and beyond by offering insightand actionable intelligence.

Everyone talks about Big Tech as the leaders in AI and data. But how many of them have real-world, government-level clients? How many can say their software has literally saved lives?

The answer is zero. Palantir is in a league of its own. That’s the competitive edge—and it’s not going anywhere.

In general though if you wanted the safest answers, the best performing inflation hedges are typically real estate, certain equity sectors (not growth), and certain bond and bond-like products.

Most of the time inflation is caused by a shortage of something.  A well run country when government needs money it barrows the money by issuing bonds.  That doesn't cause inflation.  Most of the inflation we experienced in the last few years were caused by:

*  part supply shortages during the pandemic and the resulting shutdown of manufacturing.
* or food  shortages by the pandemic and the loss of food exports from Ukraine.  Covid also killed farm animals.
*  the oil embargo of russian oil due to the invasion of Ukraine.

In the past there were periods of high inflation due to shortage of gold.  That is what almost no country today has gold based currency. Also if a country is so badly run  that no one wants to buy its bonds the government may just start printing money. which devalues the currency.  In a well run economy the government onlyprints or stamps coins to replaces damaged or worn out currency.  Or to  adjust the amount of corrency to compensate for population growth. if you don't print money and the population grows the  value of money inflates which can also be bad for an economy.","This is the one thing people don't understand.

No government from a G10 nation backs cryptos and we've even seen countries like China outright ban it. Currency only has value if it's backed by a reliable nation as legal tender.","The way I see it, gold at least has value because it's a form of reserve currency used by many if not most governments.
