Real Estate & Capital Goods
US Election Impact: All Eyes on Forward Rates
Expectations and USD/BRL Strength

Following confirmation of Donald Trump's presidential election win, we remind investors of its potential implications for our coverage universe. Overall, most of the impact to our coverage is indirect through changes in macroeconomic trends, especially real rates in Brazil and US$ strength.

Since Brazilian and Chilean Shopping Malls & Properties stocks are traded as bond proxies by investors given their ability to pass-through inflation to rents, an increase in long-term rates results in a reduction in company valuations. The spread between real long-term rates to companies' FFO yields is the main valuation metric to monitor. In light of this, a stronger USD, as well as higher inflation in the US, could imply higher inflation in Brazil and Chile and thus, higher long-term rates and an even more discounted valuation. Brazilian Malls (MULT, IGTI and ALOS) are trading at 450bps spread to 10Y real rates vs ~110bps between 2017-2020 (Trump's 1st term) while the Chilean Malls (PARAUCO, CENCOMAL) are trading at 650bps spread vs an average of ~550bps in 2017-2020. As for Homebuilders, mid & high income players (CYRE,EZTC) would be negatively impacted by higher rates which would make housing less affordable, while in the low income segment (MRVE, TEND, DIRR and CURY), government housing program MCMV creates a supportive environment – mortgage not linked to market rates – making it our preferred place to hide in the Real Estate segment. The sector is trading at a P/E 12M Fwd. of 7.2x vs 14.7x between 2017 and 2020. Bear in mind that the 10Y real rate in Brazil reached a low of 2.75% in the end of 2017-2020 period vs ~6.7% currently.

Implications for Capital Goods varies from company to company given sector end-market differences and potential policy implementations (tariffs and energy regulation). A weaker BRL would help exporters and companies with strong presence in the US – mostly EMBR/ERJ and WEG – and to some extent TUPY and MYPK. Higher inflation in Brazil – as a result of a stronger USD – likely would increase LV prices reducing demand at a time when the sector has limited pricing power given aggressive competition from Chinese OEMs, impacting companies with higher exposure to the segment in Brazil such as LEVE and MYPK. In the case of higher import tariffs favoring nearshoring production on USMCA, WEG, NEMAKA, TUPY and MYPK which have local production in the region could gain market share from competitors outside North America. On the other hand, RAPT and POMO currently have lower exposure to the US (<20% of top-line); therefore, being less impacted by potential trade wars. For WEG, every 10% depreciation in the BRL implies ~7% expansion in EBITDA. Moreover, the transformers opportunity in North America should remain in place as investments in Data Centers and AI should not be impacted by a potential change in energy generation investments. On EMBR/ERJ we also do not expect any meaningful tariff impact given the lack of US-based players producing narrowbodies with up to ~80 seats (E175 E1 jet). Moreover, Embraer's bizjets are already mostly built in Melbourne, Florida.

Important Disclosures
Company-Specific Disclosures: Important disclosures, including price charts and credit opinion history tables, are available for compendium
reports and all J.P. Morgan–covered companies, and certain non-covered companies, by visitinghttps://www.jpmm.com/research/disclosures,
calling 1-800-477-0406, or e-mailing research.disclosure.inquiries@jpmorgan.com with your request.
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will
outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe); Neutral (over
the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the
Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in
this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s
team’s, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock
because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the
price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)
and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock’s expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark
country market index, not to those Research Analysts’ coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report,
the certifying Research Analyst’s coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan’s Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.

The Global Economic Outlook: Navigating Uncertain Times

J.P. Morgan Research
November 2024

Global economic conditions remain challenging, with growth slowing in major economies. Central banks continue to balance inflation concerns with growth support measures. The report examines how these dynamics are shaping investment strategies across asset classes.

Key themes include:
- The persistence of inflationary pressures despite monetary tightening
- Geopolitical tensions affecting supply chains and trade flows
- The transition to green energy creating both challenges and opportunities
- Digital transformation accelerating across sectors
- Demographic shifts impacting labor markets and consumption patterns

This analysis provides investors with a framework for understanding current economic conditions and identifying potential investment opportunities in the context of these complex dynamics.
