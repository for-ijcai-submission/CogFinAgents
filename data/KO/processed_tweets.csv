They have current territory disputes with the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Japan, and India. They invaded Tibet and annexed it, they also invaded Vietnam in the 70s. It's not a matter of whether they would claim other nations' lands, they currently claim lands and waters that do not belong to them. The CCP's 9 Dash Line strategically claims the whole sea so that it can cut off its regional enemies. It would be like the US claiming the entirety of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean with the intent to cut central America off from Atlantic trade without our express permission. Their salami tactics are not new, but they are effective because they know the US is unwilling to come to blows over small islands or slivers of land.

>Also, TSMC has their fabs rigged to not operate in the event of an invasion.

In the event of capture, the TSMC fabs in Taiwan would no longer be an option for the US whether they were rigged or not. The invasion of Taiwan by China would trigger divestment, heavy sanctions, and probably an embargo.

>My line of inquiry is about the theoretical trajectory in which the West gets its cutting edge chips (2nm and lower) from fabs located in US and EU.

TSMC is planning to build a 2nm fab in Arizona this decade. Intel is also working on their own 2nm fabs in Germany/Israel/Arizona. The same is ongoing within the EU. Eventually these companies will catch up to TSMC, but we are looking at a decade away. 

>I suspect that Taiwan would be handed over to China as a concession - unsure if appeasement would work (see Poland) but the outcome of a full on war between US and China would be orders of magnitude worse.

Taiwan isn't a chip the US can give away to appease the CCP. Furthermore the west doesn't need to appease China because China needs the west to achieve its insane goals. Allowing China to take Taiwan would have far larger consequences than Taiwan's sovereignty—as mentioned earlier. It would be a dramatic and debilitating blow to South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines, all of whom require access to the South China Sea. So allowing Taiwan to fall into the hands of China would only make matters worse for everyone. 

A war with the US does not offer great prospects for China. They have the world's largest navy on paper, but it's outclassed. First by the US, and then by the Japanese and Royal Navy. Smaller navies in the region would also get involved—Australia, the Philippines, possibly New Zealand and Vietnam. The CCP understands that invasion of Taiwan is their Rubicon, and so far they've been playing subversive games hoping the US continues to balk. The consequences for China in such a war would likely mean the destruction of their fledgling blue-water navy (if they even took it away from shore) and full or partial naval blockade of their mainland. Something like what happened to the German navy in WW2. China would have serious problems, a naval blockade of their mainland would do far more damage in a shorter amount of time than any land invasion. The US has no reason to invade China, certainly not when it can cripple it by sea.",">What territory beyond Taiwan would China claim?

2024-11-01,KO,investing,post,1gh73tb,,,ASML: An unbeatable monopoly?,"ASML: An unbeatable monopoly?
After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML.

[ASML engineers working on one part of a machine](https://preview.redd.it/zbnjr6u2yayd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=7585c012e7baf4111a23a9d0345fb34574023d8b)

Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix.

You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter).

**1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched**. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: *“Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?”* They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again.  We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA).

[ASML roadmap](https://preview.redd.it/ti1s6bx4yayd1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9c4524acc1cfe72edb9f71708d6ea98cc73b007)

**2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers.** These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides.

**3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable.** The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts.

[Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT](https://preview.redd.it/va79p99pyayd1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb1df1f362d9c31a331461e6c2f999d4ae7e4e28)

  
Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible. ASML is a true masterpiece, built on relentless hard work and collaboration.

Over 50 serious investors have already received part one of the ASML analysis, complete with an in-depth audio analysis. If you, too, want to become a well-informed investor and deepen your understanding of the world’s top companies, consider joining TDI-Premium.

In part one of the analysis, you’ll discover:

* What it takes to produce the most complex machine on earth
* How the value chain within the chip industry is structured
* How ASML’s unique culture helped forge its monopoly

Have a wonderful day and happy investing.

VKTX has already shared promising results from their 2735 drug at a 40mg dose, demonstrating a weight loss of 3.3% with minimal side effects—essentially mirroring the placebo's safety profile. To put this into perspective, LLY's Orforglipron achieved only 3% weight loss, but 40% of patients experienced nausea. Similarly, RHHBY reported 6% weight loss, yet 70% of participants suffered from severe diarrhea.

So, what does this mean for VKTX? They will soon announce results for higher doses (60mg, 80mg, and 100mg). Given the positive response at 40mg, it's reasonable to anticipate even greater efficacy at higher doses, likely accompanied by a better tolerability profile than competitors. This could lead to a significant bullish trend for the stock.

# Acquisition Potential-

Analysts VKTX is an attractive buyout candidate, with Merck or otherspotentially looking to acquire the company for a premium in the near future.

# Strong Recent Performance-

Last week’s earnings report highlighted VKTX’s robust performance and exceptional tolerability updates. Technically, the stock experienced a substantial breakout above the key resistance level of 70, indicating a strong likelihood of reaching 100 soon.

# Positive Investor Sentiment-

Following the earnings announcement, we observed strong bullish flow, with continued interest on Friday. While some options traded at lower premiums, they indicate a compounding interest that builds on the significant orders from Thursday.

# Positioning Overview-

The current positioning is very bullish, with no significant in-the-money or out-of-the-money puts in play. Strong call options at the 90 and 95 strike prices signal investor confidence.

# Conclusion-

VKTX IS THE PLAY. With significant data releases ahead, positive technical indicators, and potential acquisition interest, I believe going all-in on VKTX could yield lambos","# Rough week. Here's an idea to save your portfolio & cultivate financial surplus. 

# Viking Therapeutics $VKTX is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel first-in-class or best-in-class therapies for the treatment of metabolic and endocrine disorders (WEIGHT LOSS) with three compounds currently in clinical trials. This is a once-in-a-decade biopharm golden egg.

# Their stock is currently trading at $73 - Let's talk plays. Step one is to buy as much stock as you can before market close TODAY. This stock will be $90 plus by Monday. You can then sell half your shares and go all in on Dec 20 $100 strike calls. Let me explain why.

2024-11-01,KO,wallstreetbets,post,1ghbw6y,,,🚀 Why I'm Betting on Berkshire (BRK.B) Popping After Earnings 🚀,"🚀 Why I'm Betting on Berkshire (BRK.B) Popping After Earnings 🚀
Alright, fellow apes and diamond hands 🦍💎, let’s talk Berkshire Hathaway (aka BRK.B) and why I think Monday's pre-market might just be the gain we’re looking for. Buffett’s dropping Q3 earnings this weekend, and I’m feeling good about a *pop* next week. Here’s the scoop:

# 💰 Cash Mountain - Literally Enough to Buy a Small Country

First off, Berkshire’s sitting on **$276 BILLION in cash**. Yeah, that’s ""I'm going to buy a country"" money 💸. Warren’s stash in U.S. Treasury bills alone is over $230 billion (looking at you, GDP of New Zealand). With that much cash, Berkshire’s primed for any buying spree that makes sense, and that stability is juicy for investors.

# 🔮 Earnings Estimates & Big Money Moves

Analysts expect **$4.81 EPS** for Q3. Sure, it’s a bit shy compared to last year, but remember how they crushed it last quarter with $5.38 per share against a $4.83 prediction? Another earnings beat here could mean we’re looking at a nice Monday pre-market jump.

# 📈 Technical Signals: Riding Near the Edge of a Breakout

BRK.B is hovering around its moving averages, ready for a breakout:

* **50-Day**: $457.73
* **100-Day**: $460.40
* **200-Day**: $457.90

Basically, it’s like waiting on the edge of a cliff for the wind to pick up. The **MACD** is looking positive, and the **RSI** is at 57.62—neither too hot nor too cold, juuust right.

# 🎲 My Play: BRK.B Shares & Long Calls

For this one, I’m thinking:

* **Adding BRK.B shares** if we can snag ‘em under $450, riding them to $480 or beyond.
* **Picking up some $450 LEAP calls** (I’m talking way out, like Feb/April 2025) to catch any Buffett-borne magic that compounds over time.

# Bottom Line:

Buffett and crew are known to keep it steady, but with these indicators and cash at the ready, we might just see a bit of Berkshire bounce next week. Thoughts? Anyone else going in with some shares or taking a shot on those LEAPs?","Alright, fellow apes and diamond hands 🦍💎, let’s talk Berkshire Hathaway (aka BRK.B) and why I think Monday's pre-market might just be the gain we’re looking for.

Guten Morgen 
Ich habe ein Problem und bräuchte einen Rat wie ich aus der Situation freigesprochen werden kann. Es geht darum das ich die Tage zur Polizei als beschuldigte wegen Geldwäsche vorgeladen wurde. Ich bin natürlich hin da ich mir nichts bei gedacht habe, weil ich bis heute nichts getan haben außer 2019 meinen personalausweis verloren habe. Ich vermutete das jemand mit meinem perso was angestellt hat. Dies war leider nicht der Fall. Es wurde in einem anderen Bundesland jemand via Telefonbetrug aufgefordert Geld von seiner Kreditkarte auf eine Binance wallet zu senden, was er dann auch getan hat. Der Herr hat an einem Sonntag einen angeblichen Anruf von seiner Hausbank erhalten und wurde zu der Zahlung aufgefordert. Die Betrüger am Telefon übermittelten den Herrn wohl eine transaktionsnummer die er zum  zahlen angeben sollte. Er tätigte die Zahlung dann wohl auch woraufhin seine Frau stutzig wurde und bei der Bank anrief. Diese sagte dem Herrn dann wohl das die Aufforderung nicht von ihnen war und das er betrogen wurde. Das Geld wurde dann von der Bank wohl zurückgezogen. Ich besitze selber ein Binance Konto welches ich auch aktiv nutze, das Geld was der Herr gesendet hat soll auf meinen Namen zurückverfolgt worden sein. Ich habe aber nichts mit dem Vorfall zutun kann all meine Geld Eingänge Ausgänge belegen und habe auch auf meiner Order Historie keine Eingänge die nicht von mir sind. Dies habe ich der Polizei auch so übermittelt. Die Dame bei der Polizei glaubt mir aber nicht weil das Geld versucht wurde an mein Binance Konto transferiert zu werden und weil Binance unter der transaktionsnummer meine kontodaten ermittelt hat und diese der Polizei übermittelt hat. Es soll kein Geld angekommen sein aber mein Name ist gefallen. Ich habe auch schon Kontoauszüge Eingänge Ausgänge und Screenshots eingereicht. Die Polizistin meinte zu mir das ich mein Konto Betrügern gegeben haben könnte und mitschuldig sein könnte. Dies ist nicht der Fall. Was kann ich noch tun um meine Unschuld zu beweisen, beim Anwalt war ich noch nicht weil ich keine Rechtsschutzversicherung habe was meine eigene Dummheit ist.
Ich wäre um jeden Rat dankbar.","Guten Morgen

Hello, I believe opportunity to beat the market is in finding market ineffectiveness. How much market ineffectiveness do you believe, there is in different information availability between languages?

Why I am asking.

Last week ČEZ has bought 20% of Rolls Royce SMR. And it was massive event in Czech language. Largest net newspaper had article about it on the frontage. (remainder google translate can translate web-pages if you want to read).

Largest newspaper article: https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/ekonomika-firmy-cez-koupi-za-miliardy-podil-v-rolls-royce-smr-budou-vyrabet-reaktory-263383

Web about investing: https://www.kurzy.cz/firmy/cez-rolls-royce/

everybody was writing about it. So I thought: I want to see what English speakers think about it. And there was nothing. I bought shares and 1 call. Thinking once they translate the news, market will react. I am already waiting a week. And nothing. When I look at Yahoo finance nothing happened at all. When I look at seeking alpha or IBKR. One simple article, no analysis or discussion.

20% of SMR company has been bought by corporation which has almost monopoly for energy in Czech republic (because it would be illegal to have perfect monopoly). ČEZ talks about need to build up to 10 SMR to replace coal heat/power plants in coming years. ČEZ has recently also bought Škoda JS (Škoda nuclear engineering). That company has produced nuclear reactors in the past. And still has all the tools and facilities to produce nuclear reactors. They have “unused” reactor hall which is currently producing storage units for spent nuclear fuel, because nobody orders reactors today. RR is producing SMR design to be build in factory. ČEZ owns a factory for nuclear reactors in middle of EU. And no one speaks about the synergy. 

Reaction of the market, whole weak of nothing -1%. As if there were no news. So it got me thinking, how often this happens? Do you know any other example of events which has vastly different information availability or point of view based on language?

*Disclosure: I have 500 shares of RR and 1 RR call, bought this week, and ČEZ shares long term unrelated to this.*","Hello, I believe opportunity to beat the market is in finding market ineffectiveness.

If you are new to investing, you can find curated resources in the r/investing wiki for [Getting Started here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/gettingstarted/). 

The reading list in the wiki and FAQ has a list of books ranging from light reading to advanced topics depending on your knowledge level. Link here - [Reading List](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/readinglist)

Podcasts and videos can be found in the wiki here - [Podcasts and videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/medialist)

If you know nothing about the capital markets - the Getting Started section at the SEC educational site can be a good place to start - [investor.gov](https://investor.gov) \- there are also short 30 second videos on basics. The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is a US regulator with a focus to protect US investors through regulatory oversight of the securities markets.

The FINRA education site at [FINRA Education](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest) also contains numerous free courses and educational materials. FINRA is a not-for-profit SRO (self regulatory organization) which is self-funded by it's members which are broker-dealers. It works under the supervision of the SEC with a mandate to protect the investing public against fraud and bad practice.

For formal educational materials, several colleges and universities make their course work available for free. 

If want to learn about the financial markets - an older but reasonably relevant course is [Financial Markets (2011) - Yale University](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8FB14A2200B87185) This is the introduction to financial markets course taught by Prof. Shiller from Yale. Prof Shiller won the Nobel prize in economics in 2013.

Another relavant course from MIT is a lecture series on Finance Theory taught by Prof Andrew Lo - [Financial Theory (2008) - MIT](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63B2lDhyKOsImI7FjCf6eDW).

A more current course can be found at NYU Stern School of Business by Prof Aswath Damodaran - [Corporate Finance Spring 2019](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcastcfspr19.htm). Prof Damodaran offers the latest materials and webcast lectures to this class here - https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/corpfin.html","Your post has been removed because it is a common beginner topic.

The dead giveaway might be the fact they've invaded Moldova, Chechnya, Georgia, and Ukraine, interfered in a significant way in elections all over the world, support countries and terrorist organizations like North Korea, Iran, Hama, etc around the world, don't have real elections, freedom of the press, or freedom of speech, assassinate and commit acts of sabotage in western countries, have factories that turn out disinformation and fund people that try and turn people against each other, ban gay rights, make domestic abuse legal, cyber attack western companies and governments constantly, put anti-satellite weapons in space, weaponize oil and food exports to try and control foreign governments, threatened nuclear war 10,000 times, oppress and steal from it's own people, maintain and subjugate countless numbers of ethnic minorities that couldn't fight back as part of the large reason 19th century empire in the world, etc, etc, etc.  That's just recently, this sort of stuff has been going on for 300+ years.  There was a brief period in the 90s we though that might change. 

Of course invading Ukraine for absolutely no valid reason, targeting Childrens hospitals with missile attacks, murdering people in areas it controls, blowing up damns and releasing toxic chemicals in rivers to will all life in them, etc should have made it obvious to even the most ignorant of history to understand unless they are a complete piece of shit human being.","> Why is Russia always the boogey man?

When you have a large scale conflict like this would be, with enough nuke capable countries involved, somebody is going to let one fly... and if one flies, a bunch more are going to fly.  It won't be pretty and the stock market will be the last of anyone's concern because only hard assets will be worth anything.  

There will be no winners in this if it happens.  Hopefully the closest it will come is in a Hollywood movie and John Wick didn't really die.

firstly, RIP Peanut. legend. scavenger. son. brother.

after witnessing the drastic government overreach this past week i started to ponder if we would start to see widespread enforcement of pet animal euthanasia across the US. this alongside the ""overhang"" of pets from people irresponsibly becoming owners temporarily over the pandemic is likely leading to increased numbers of animals sitting in shelters with hard stop dates. it seems more likely that under a Harris government (Trump side already vocally pro-Peanut) we could see more of our beloved animals come under threat so one could look at this trade as a hedge to any Trump bets you may have

after some digging it seems that the most likely method of euthanasia was an injectable barbiturate solution like sodium pentobarbital. the brand name for this is Nembutal, and i kid you not, a company that was well associated with this drug used to be Akorn Pharmaceuticals (sign??). fortunately/unfortunately they went bankrupt. so i did some more digging and there doesn't seem to be any US publicly traded stocks that notably produce products in this space but there is one in France - Virbac - that creates Euthasol. it's up around 30% in the last year. if the US keeps going after our pet squirrels it's a sad day for mankind but if you're looking for an emotional and election hedge, perhaps Virbac is the play

2024-11-04,KO,wallstreetbets,post,1gjc5p6,,,A new Space Race in the making? $RKLB,"A new Space Race in the making? $RKLB
The next space race is down to two big plays - Moon Manned mission and Mars sample return:

1. Return to the Moon: Artemis program is aiming for a lunar return, but the SL5 rocket’s got a bad rep for being expensive and behind schedule. Artemis 3 delays keep stacking, and SpaceX isn’t totally sold on the Moon either. Meanwhile, China is all-in for 2030.

2. Mission to Mars: Elon’s pumped about Mars, eyeing an uncrewed mission by 2026 and a crewed one by late 2028, but you know how his timelines go. China’s pushing for an early Mars sample return by 2028—moved up from originally planned 2031, meaning they are serious and ambitious. NASA’s got about a dozen ideas on the table, including a Rocket Lab proposal.

Rocket Lab is aiming to bring samples back by 2031 with a $2 billion concept that uses two Neutron rockets. One orbiter, one lander—it grabs up to 30 samples from Perseverance, sending them back home for under $2 billion if all goes to plan.

With this $2 billion contract to be decided by end of 2024 (likely December), Rocket Lab ($RKLB) is one to watch. Their market cap’s at $5.6 billion. Picked up some around $3-4; it’s a little high now, but definitely long term lookout.

1. Return to the Moon: Artemis program is aiming for a lunar return, but the SL5 rocket’s got a bad rep for being expensive and behind schedule. Artemis 3 delays keep stacking, and SpaceX isn’t totally sold on the Moon either. Meanwhile, China is all-in for 2030.

2. Mission to Mars: Elon’s pumped about Mars, eyeing an uncrewed mission by 2026 and a crewed one by late 2028, but you know how his timelines go. China’s pushing for an early Mars sample return by 2028—moved up from originally planned 2031, meaning they are serious and ambitious. NASA’s got about a dozen ideas on the table, including a Rocket Lab proposal.

Rocket Lab is aiming to bring samples back by 2031 with a $2 billion concept that uses two Neutron rockets. One orbiter, one lander—it grabs up to 30 samples from Perseverance, sending them back home for under $2 billion if all goes to plan.

With this $2 billion contract to be decided by end of 2024 (likely December), Rocket Lab ($RKLB) is one to watch. Their market cap’s at $5.6 billion. Picked up some around $3-4; it’s a little high now, but definitely long term lookout.

firstly, RIP Peanut. legend. scavenger. son. brother.

after witnessing the drastic government overreach this past week i started to ponder if we would start to see widespread enforcement of pet animal euthanasia across the US. this alongside the ""overhang"" of pets from people irresponsibly becoming owners temporarily over the pandemic is likely leading to increased numbers of animals sitting in shelters with hard stop dates. it seems more likely that under a Harris government (Trump side already vocally pro-Peanut) we could see more of our beloved animals come under threat so one could look at this trade as a hedge to any Trump bets you may have

after some digging it seems that the most likely method of euthanasia was an injectable barbiturate solution like sodium pentobarbital. the brand name for this is Nembutal, and i kid you not, a company that was well associated with this drug used to be Akorn Pharmaceuticals (sign??). fortunately/unfortunately they went bankrupt. so i did some more digging and there doesn't seem to be any US publicly traded stocks that notably produce products in this space but there is one in France - Virbac - that creates Euthasol. it's up around 30% in the last year. if the US keeps going after our pet squirrels it's a sad day for mankind but if you're looking for an emotional and election hedge, perhaps Virbac is the play","firstly, RIP Peanut. legend. scavenger. son. brother.

2024-11-04,KO,wallstreetbets,post,1gj698f,,,"INTA: Solid AI Play, Targeting $75 by End of 2025 🚀","INTA: Solid AI Play, Targeting $75 by End of 2025 🚀
Alright, folks, let’s dive into **Intapp, Inc. (INTA),** this isn’t your typical AI stock that just slaps “AI” onto the name. Intapp’s got the real stuff. They provide cloud-based software for professional services (think law firms, banks, consultants) essential infrastructure that these businesses need to stay competitive. They’ve built AI and machine learning directly into their products, making them a key player in a hot market. Here’s why **I’m targeting $75 by the end of 2025** on this one.

**1. Earnings That Don’t Disappoint**

This isn’t a company just hoping for growth – they’re delivering. Intapp has crushed earnings expectations in the last four quarters:

* **Q4 FY2024 (June 30, 2024):** Revenue hit $114.38 million (+20.9% YoY), EPS of $0.15 (beat expectations of $0.12)
* **Q3 FY2024:** $110.64 million in revenue, up from $92.02 million the previous year, EPS of $0.14 (crushed the $0.07 estimate)
* **Q2 FY2024:** $103.93 million in revenue, a 22.7% growth, EPS of $0.11 (expected $0.05)
* **Q1 FY2024:** $101.58 million in revenue, up 27.7%, EPS of $0.06 (expected $0.03)

This steady earnings growth shows they’re not messing around, they’re finding ways to grow revenue consistently, and the demand is clearly there. This kind of growth means they’re doing something right, giving them the power to reinvest and expand. Investors are taking note, and that can only mean good things for long-term growth.

**2. Smack in the Middle of the AI Boom**

AI is the golden ticket right now, and Intapp’s got one. They’re using machine learning and AI to power business intelligence and analytics for their clients, not just talk. That means real value for the end-users, not just empty promises. The professional services sector is warming up to AI fast, and Intapp’s right there, ready to deliver. This isn’t just hype; it’s a well-placed bet in an exploding sector.

**3. Strong Market Conditions**

With the market rallying, growth stocks like Intapp have the wind at their backs. As long as the macro stays favorable, this setup is a win-win. Even if there’s a pullback, Intapp’s fundamentals should give them the resilience to weather it. They’ve got the right stuff to keep investors interested.

**4. Technicals Screaming Breakout 📈**

Look at the chart, and it’s clear: Intapp’s testing a big resistance at **$52**. A breakout above that level could mean serious upside. We’re seeing strong support holding, volume building up, and indicators aligning for a potential rally. Once we’re over $52, it’s blue skies ahead, and my target of $75 by 2025 is very much on the table.

**Bottom Line: Long INTA to the Moon 🚀**

With solid earnings, strong growth in AI, favorable market conditions, and a technical setup that looks ready to pop, **INTA’s got legs**. This isn’t financial advice, but I’m bullish here.  $75 by 2025 looks like a very real target.

# Seizing Short-Term Opportunities in Eastman Chemical Amid Export Control Changes

Eastman Chemical Company is a major player in the chemical sector, well-positioned to meet the rising demand for compliant chemical precursors in agriculture and medical applications, especially as it navigates new export regulations.

# Anticipating Demand Boost from New Export Controls

The recent implementation of strict export controls against Russia and Belarus introduces a unique opportunity for Eastman Chemical. As competitors face restrictions, Eastman's alignment with legitimate civilian applications enhances its competitive edge in the market. Investors should watch for increased sales in chemical precursors used in agriculture and medical fields, which are now in greater demand.

# Rising Profit Expectations for Eastman Chemical

Eastman Chemical reported a profit that outpaced expectations, primarily driven by increasing sales in strategic segments. The company’s robust performance amid tightening global regulations positions it as a reliable investment during uncertain market conditions. Investors could capitalize on this momentum as more buyers seek legitimate chemical sources amidst geopolitical tensions.

# Undervalued Stock with Growth Potential

Analysts identify Eastman Chemical as an undervalued stock with significant growth potential, particularly in light of recent market shifts and increased domestic demand. With supply chain considerations becoming paramount, Eastman's commitment to compliant sourcing makes it an attractive candidate for short-term investments. Investors should consider taking positions before wider recognition of its value.

# Market Trends Favoring Eastman's Strategic Position

The tightening of export controls creates a favorable market environment for firms like Eastman Chemical, poised to benefit from the compliance-driven segment of the chemical industry. As Eastman diversifies its product lines towards sustainable and legitimate applications, it not only addresses immediate market needs but also enhances its long-term value proposition.

The reading list in the wiki and FAQ has a list of books ranging from light reading to advanced topics depending on your knowledge level. Link here - [Reading List](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/readinglist)

Podcasts and videos can be found in the wiki here - [Podcasts and videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/medialist)

If you know nothing about the capital markets - the Getting Started section at the SEC educational site can be a good place to start - [investor.gov](https://investor.gov) \- there are also short 30 second videos on basics. The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is a US regulator with a focus to protect US investors through regulatory oversight of the securities markets.

The FINRA education site at [FINRA Education](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest) also contains numerous free courses and educational materials. FINRA is a not-for-profit SRO (self regulatory organization) which is self-funded by it's members which are broker-dealers. It works under the supervision of the SEC with a mandate to protect the investing public against fraud and bad practice.

For formal educational materials, several colleges and universities make their course work available for free. 

If want to learn about the financial markets - an older but reasonably relevant course is [Financial Markets (2011) - Yale University](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8FB14A2200B87185) This is the introduction to financial markets course taught by Prof. Shiller from Yale.

**Boeing as a Potential Investment Opportunity**

Boeing stands as one of the most important players in the aerospace industry, with a heavily established brand and legacy that commands trust around the world. Despite recent operational and financial challenges affecting its stock price, Boeing’s intrinsic value and reputation position it as a viable investment. While relatively short-term setbacks have impacted shareholder sentiment, these issues are likely irrelevant in terms of Boeing’s long-term prospects as a leader in aviation. For a company of Boeing’s stature, resilience and success are inevitable, making it a viable investment opportunity amidst doubt in the markets.

**Boeing’s Brand Strength and Market Perception**

Since its founding in 1916, Boeing has had a long-standing reputation for safety and reliability. The company has bolstered its reputation through engineering marvels like the Boeing 747. Although Boeing has recently had many notable incidents, they have focused on being transparent and open with its shareholders. For example, production issues with the 787 Dreamliner, delays in the 777X program, software glitches affecting 737 MAX deliveries, supply chain disruptions, and quality control concerns have been openly handled by the company as they have been in direct communication with the National Transportation Safety Board in order to improve and learn from their mistakes. Another key factor is brand loyalty. Boeing’s brand strength is comparable to companies such as Coca-Cola and Apple. This loyalty and strength has been based on customer trust, market stability, innovation, and collaboration. Ultimately, Boeing’s long-standing reputation allows it to build strong brand loyalty, further bolstering its position in the aerospace industry and ensuring its continued relevance and resilience in the market. 

Boeing has a huge brand name that involves years of experience in the market, which competitors like COMAC and others lack. Boeing also has government contracts on military vehicles, with the V-22 Osprey and Air Force One being two of the most well-known. Three years ago, Chinese airframer COMAC landed on the US government's blacklist of “communist Chinese military companies,” where it could face sanctions and other boycotts. This shone a negative light on COMAC’s reliability. In combination with its long standing history of serving US citizens, Boeing is set far ahead of their competitors.

**Operational Challenges and Financial Setbacks**

Boeing has faced several operational and financial setbacks that have significantly impacted its stock price, including manufacturing delays and supply chain disruptions, particularly in the production of its 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Additionally, protests from employees and labor unions over working conditions have strained internal dynamics, contributing to production slowdowns. Financially, Boeing has struggled with rising costs and has faced accusations of fraud and misleading investors, including a high-profile lawsuit related to the 737 Max crashes. These issues have collectively damaged investor confidence, further pressuring Boeing’s stock performance as it navigates these challenges.

Boeing’s financial strategy has recently centered on a significant $10 billion credit agreement aimed at facilitating recovery in the wake of industry challenges. This move not only addresses immediate liquidity needs but also signals confidence in long-term growth prospects. The funds are expected to support investment in new technologies and production capabilities, enhancing Boeing’s competitive position. 

**Sustained Market Demand for Aircraft**

Boeing’s $400 billion order backlog highlights sustained demand and supports financial stability amid challenges. Orders for key models like the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner show strong client confidence, positioning Boeing for recovery as it addresses production issues. This pipeline of demand reinforces Boeing’s market position, providing investors a solid foundation for long-term growth. 

The global demand for air travel has received significant growth over recent years, particularly in emerging markets such as China, India, and Southeast Asia. Rising incomes, urbanization, economic growth, and an expanding middle class are driving increased travel in regions like China, India, and Southeast Asia, contributing to a broader shift in air travel trends. These areas are experiencing significant growth in demand, caused by economic expansion and government investments. China is on track to become the world’s largest aviation market by the mid-2030s, with massive infrastructure projects underway. India, supported by initiatives like UDAN, is expected to become the third-largest aviation market within a decade as air travel increasingly replaces other modes of domestic transport. In Southeast Asia, countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand are seeing strong growth, with low-cost carriers making flights more accessible. These regions will shape the future of global air travel, where infrastructure and sustainable technologies will be essential.

**Valuation and Investment Prospects**

Since its 52-week high, Boeing has dropped 40%. This fall in share price is due to ongoing production delays, regulatory challenges, weakened defense contract demand, broader economic concerns, and disruptions from recent labor strikes affecting suppliers. In 2019, the stock price was a staggering $430. This peak came before the 737-MAX crises and the COVID-19 Pandemic, Boeing has dropped nearly 65% since then. Through Boeing’s fall over the past 5 years, their competitors, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman have grown 85%, 75%, and 94%, respectively. Despite this divergence, Boeing still has a 15-20% market share in the Defense and Aerospace Industry domestically, in addition to their 45%-50% stake in Commercial Aviation as they are in a duopoly with Airbus. Additionally, Boeing's extensive order backlog signals strong demand, suggesting a potential path to recovery as global air travel rebounds. While challenges remain, addressing these operational hurdles could enable Boeing to leverage its dominant position in aerospace, driving a potential comeback toward pre-pandemic performance levels.

**Key Risk Factors Impacting Boeing**

Boeing has a number of regulation issues like the recertification of the 737 MAX which was heavily scrutinized by the FAA and other aviation authorities. The aircraft was allowed for flight but Boeing’s continuous oversight and compliance has been a focus since 2021. Boeing has also had production quality issues, specifically with the 787 Dreamliner having damaged parts, unsecured fuel lines, and multiple other issues. Additionally,in 2021, the European Union proposed stricter emissions standards which may affect Boeing’s future production practices. Boeing continues to be under investigation for various issues under the FAA and other global aviation authorities about lying to regulators about the safety of aircrafts and cutting corners.

Boeing's Defense and Space division has struggled with substantial challenges over recent years. Despite its strong foothold in defense, Boeing faces ongoing challenges including production delays and quality control concerns in key programs like the KC-46 Pegasus and P-8 Poseidon. Additionally, the company has struggled with significant cost overruns and navigating a competitive landscape. Despite this, Boeing is committed to innovation and improving efficiency, which is vital for securing future government contracts. On the other hand, marred by years of glitches, Boeing has also faced over $1.6 billion in cost overruns and delays in its space sector. Boeing’s Starliner project has faced many setbacks, while their rival, Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has made 43 visits to the International Space Station since 2019. As a result, Boeing is considering selling this project and stepping away from the space sector after over 60 years in the industry. However, NASA and Boeing are actively working to solve these issues to get Starliner up and running once again, which, if successful, could diminish some concerns associated with the company’s future in the space sector.

**Boeing’s Path to Recovery and Future Outlook**

In conclusion, Boeing’s promising potential for recovery is characterized by two factors: its substantial market share/strong brand image and how harshly the market has reacted to the company's setbacks, ignoring major potential in the company’s extensive order backlogs. Boeing’s major losses, such as the pandemic-incited 737 MAX crisis, allegations of fraud in overstated production goals, federal investigation into regulatory non-compliance, and quality control issues across multiple aircraft models were largely managerial issues that are being priced in too harshly, ignoring the fact that Boeing maintains a notable global presence in the aerospace industry. Approximately 50% of the machine supply in the commercial aircraft market is due to Boeing, the other 50% belonging to Airbus with Boeing also controlling about 20% of the Defense and Aerospace Industry. These statistics emphasize the company’s strong presence, highlighting that the managerials issues of the past can be overcome.","**Boeing as a Potential Investment Opportunity**

However, NASA and Boeing are actively working to solve these issues to get Starliner up and running once again, which, if successful, could diminish some concerns associated with the company’s future in the space sector.

**Boeing’s Path to Recovery and Future Outlook**

In conclusion, Boeing’s promising potential for recovery is characterized by two factors: its substantial market share/strong brand image and how harshly the market has reacted to the company's setbacks, ignoring major potential in the company’s extensive order backlogs. Boeing’s major losses, such as the pandemic-incited 737 MAX crisis, allegations of fraud in overstated production goals, federal investigation into regulatory non-compliance, and quality control issues across multiple aircraft models were largely managerial issues that are being priced in too harshly, ignoring the fact that Boeing maintains a notable global presence in the aerospace industry. Approximately 50% of the machine supply in the commercial aircraft market is due to Boeing, the other 50% belonging to Airbus with Boeing also controlling about 20% of the Defense and Aerospace Industry. These statistics emphasize the company’s strong presence, highlighting that the managerials issues of the past can be overcome.

Apple iPhone 17 series is surely coming in fall 2025 and rumor has it that they will be cutting ties with Broadcom, their WiFi and Bluetooth chip supplier. So, the WiFi 7 chip used inside that lineup will be Apple-made. This is what Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported in his leak.

They did it with their self-made 5G chip, so it shouldn’t be hard for Apple to make their proprietary WiFi 7 Chip. Kuo says that it’s a TSMC 7nm node used to create this new WiFi chip, and no doubt, Apple will slowly put it inside every one of its products in the next three years.

Which means they need a factory. **Easiest way is to buy Akoustis.**  They have the products, Wifi7 technology, factory and engineers.  On top of that, they are near bankruptcy.

This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on technical analysis (TA), but if TA is not your thing then just ignore the theme.

Some helpful day to day links, including news:

* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks
* [Bloomberg market news](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets)
* StreetInsider news:
  * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips
  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news

-----

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Wubo TV. A stock that's been dumping shit on many portfolios for the past year. It has brought red red misery to many degens. Promise I can assure you. I too have a red shitstained portfolio because of Fuckbo TV. 

Now as a holder of Fuckbong TV. I'm gonna make a case for this stock. Those who are lucky to read this. In time. You'll be pretty fucking fat and rich. Counting your stacks of Vietnamese Dong next to a Laotian Boat Prison along the Mekong. I've certainly been in one before . In the COD Black Ops 1... Same shit different body. Anyways enough rambling. Time to self reflect.

Wubo TV is heading in the right direction. With the winning of the last court case against the big dogs Fox, Disney and Warner Bros. We saw the stock pumped up to 20%. This goes to show whenever good news come in the way of this stock. It certainly pumps. For the past year every quarter. Wubo has been reporting beat by beats. Q3 2024 they reported a 21% Year over Year growth. 2025 we can anticipate a Free Cash Flow in the company. I do not have a crystal ball but I do have testicles. And they shine with might telling me that from the consistent effort the Wubo management team is doing. Reducing their net loss every quarter. This consistent effort from a passionate management team will ensure a fruitful future for Wubo. I'm being realistic. Wubo won't be the next Fox or Warner. But they are on right track every quarter. This is obviously a waiting game. Not for paper hands. By next year we can see some positive outlooks for Wubo.

Vanguard. Well known smart money yoyos also increased their holdings in WuboTV to a total of 17,298,733 shares. This stock is undervalued and it should sit at a fair valuation of 2.66$

WuboTV has expanded its content offerings through a partnership with The Athletic, allowing for cross-promotional opportunities and enhanced content variety on its platform. To further attract and retain subscribers, WuboTV has introduced new subscription tiers, enabling users to access services like Paramount+, NBA League Pass, and The FanDuel Sports Network as standalone options.

Wubo TV saw subscription revenue rise to $356.5 million, compared to $289.6 million in the same period of 2023.

Wubo TV did trim its net loss from continuing operations to $54.7 million, or an adjusted 8 cents per-share loss, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $84.4 million, or an adjusted EPS loss of 22 cents in the third quarter of 2023. Losses which Wubo has been steadily cutting and we will see profits rolling in next year or at least by 2026.

Wubo is bringing it's financial on the right track.

This is the easiest money anyone can make. You don't even need to buy call options. Just buy a couple grand of the underlying stock. And watch it print.

October 2025 will see another court case in which wubo will fight against Disney , Warner and Fox . Which I'm positive they will win again .

All I ask is . Buy a small amount. Don't get greedy. If you win you will win big. If U you lose. You will lose small

Wubo TV did trim its net loss from continuing operations to $54.7 million, or an adjusted 8 cents per-share loss, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $84.4 million, or an adjusted EPS loss of 22 cents in the third quarter of 2023. Losses which Wubo has been steadily cutting and we will see profits rolling in next year or at least by 2026.

Wubo is bringing it's financial on the right track.

This is the easiest money anyone can make. You don't even need to buy call options. Just buy a couple grand of the underlying stock. And watch it print.

October 2025 will see another court case in which wubo will fight against Disney , Warner and Fox . Which I'm positive they will win again .

All I ask is . Buy a small amount. Don't get greedy. If you win you will win big. If U you lose. You will lose small

Kindest regards,

A fellow armpit smeller",1,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gk3z8r/wubotv_is_set_to_print_tendies/,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gk3z8r/wubotv_is_set_to_print_tendies/,reddit

2024-11-05,KO,investing,post,1gk65u0,,,EF Hutton sets 30$ price target for ImmunityB,"EF Hutton sets 30$ price target for ImmunityB
IBRX, a biotech company developing novel cancer treatments, has been valued at $30 per share in a coverage initiation report by EF Hutton, an investment bank. The bank’s target price for ImmunityBio is more than seven times the October 24 close.

EF Hutton analyst **Jason Kolbert** has set a target price of $30 per share for ImmunityBio, for upside of over 600% and representing the highest target price on Wall Stree

>

ImmunityBio is developing new treatments for cancer and infectious diseases. It was founded in 2014 by Dr. **Patrick Soon-Shiong**, who has investigated mechanisms to activate the immune system to attack tumors for the last two decades. In April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved ImmunityBio’s first drug, Anktiva, for BCG-unresponsive bladder cancer in adults. The company claims that 30–40% of patients fail to respond to the widely used BCG treatment, while half of those who initially responded see a recurrence.

ImmunityBio is currently conducting 27 clinical trials across 13 indications, including studying Anktiva for non-small-cell lung cancer and a vaccine for certain types of cancer. EF Hutton’s Kolbert sees particular promise in Anktiva’s ability to convert cold tumors into hot ones. Hot tumors have more immune cells, meaning the immune system can more effectively detect and attack them, while cold tumors have fewer immune cells. Kolbert believes that ImmunityBio’s therapy could potentially improve treatment outcomes by making “cold-tumor” cancers, like glioblastoma, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, more vulnerable to an immune system attack.

Right now, I’m facing a potential 10% loss on my KO stock, which makes up 40% of my portfolio. The rest of my portfolio is split between ETFs like SPY, VTI, SCHD, and VYMI.

I’ve asked a few people I trust, and they all agree that having 40% in a single stock is pretty aggressive, even if it’s KO, and that I should think about diversifying. I’m torn between diversifying now and taking the loss, or holding on and waiting for it to recover before diversifying.

Any advice or thoughts would be really appreciated!

Just got done with zendesk support. FYI, I don't blame them. They are only doing there job with what they are given to work with. I blame management.

I will call the support person zendesk. FYI, zendesk is a step higher of support than standard support.

Zendesk said they checked with engineering and they are now not seeing the same results even though initially they did. After refreshing the page a few times they were able to get to checkout. 

They then said that if I continue to see the same error after refreshing. Yes I do. When I click on my cart I get a white screen with ""uh oh something has gone awry"". And cannot access the cart unless Etsy removes the items at a time.

But, Zendesk said if this keeps happening, of course it will as nothing has been fixed. Anyway, that I will need to check out each time with fewer items. Which is what the support person said the other day. I said to him, surely you understand how ridiculous this is? He said, ""I do, really I do"".

Etsy would not know how many buyers this happens to. They would only know if that buyer contacted support. Most would abandon Etsy and probably do if this happens to them. I don't want to check out in smaller amounts. That is frustrating. Plus if the seller has large order discounts the buyer would lose on that.

Companies like PG, KO, and JNJ are trading at reasonable multiples compared to the tech sector. They've got rock-solid balance sheets, consistent cash flows, and decades of dividend growth.

Energy stocks are also looking decent after getting beaten down last year. The sector's trading below historical averages and these companies are pumping out massive free cash flow. Plus they're returning a ton of capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.

Insurance companies are another overlooked sector. They benefit from higher interest rates on their float and many are trading below book value. Berkshire's been loading up on insurance companies lately, which is always a good sign.

In what way? Hookers and blow? Do they already own a house? Didn't they already miss step-up benefit for estate sale? 

How many siblings do you have? Are you set to inherit your parent's wealth? If so, why not ask them to let you buy from them and they become the bank since it's already paid off?

**TLDR**: China stocks are at it again. Their government are having some top financial meeting from Nov 4 to Nov 8 with rumors that there would be a much bigger stimulus in preparation for the new king in the West. If and when China goes ahead with this rumored great wall stimulus, their economy will boom, which means stock market go up, people want to be degenerates and will gamble and trade, more users are going to pile up and so the cycle goes on and on. All of what I have mentioned are good for TIGR, more degens = more revenues. Ever since the China stock market went ballistic last month, a lot of news came out stating that there was a huge amount of newly opened accounts to trade/invest stocks and Im sure some of it should have been opened with TIGR.

On Wednesday, Donald Trump's victory over Harris to win the U.S. presidential election prompted a surge in Tesla shares as Tesla investors argued that the Trump 2.0 era would favor big money's Elon Musk's business empire

　　Tesla shares closed up 14.75% to $288.53 on Wednesday, hitting a new high since July 2023

　　That jumped Tesla CEO Musk's wealth by about $20.9 billion, increasing his total wealth to nearly $286 billion and further cementing his position as the world's richest man

　　Musk was a key ally of Trump's during the campaign, and in the weeks leading up to the election, the market viewed Tesla as one of the “Trump deals”

　　Trump heaped praise on Musk during his victory speech at the Palm Beach Convention Center in Florida early Wednesday morning local time

　　“We have a rising star; a star is born: Elon,” Trump said. “He's a marvelous man. We're sitting together tonight. He spent two weeks campaigning in different parts of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania.”

　　After Trump's victory, Musk laughed and said he “doesn't have to think about going to a labor camp” and that he will be safe for the next five years. He had previously said that if Trump lost, he would be “screwed.”
Bad for the electric car industry as a whole

　　However, the potential reduction of electric vehicle rebates and tax incentives after Trump takes office could adversely affect other companies in the electric vehicle industry

　　On Wednesday, investors fled other EV stocks, with shares of Rivian and Nikola falling more than 8 percent and nearly 2 percent, respectively

　　“We think the election of Trump as president is bad for the EV industry as a whole as EV rebates/tax incentives may be eliminated, but for Tesla, we think it's a huge positive.” Wade Bush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a report Wednesday","On Wednesday, Donald Trump's victory over Harris to win the U.S. presidential election prompted a surge in Tesla shares as Tesla investors argued that the Trump 2.0 era would favor big money's Elon Musk's business empire

They run out of medications, cancel scripts on a whim, &take FOREVER to fill scripts(my doc sends electronically, it takes 24-72h to get through processing, then another 48-72h to fill, then they mail it, the whole thing takes around 7-14days).

Because of the levels of bureaucracy in a company that size, everyone you speak to will tell you something different, some agents are great, some are awful. I went 28mos in a row with a mistake/issue EVERY MONTH. Those 28mos I received 23mos of medications to their delays and ineptitude....and that was WITH daily calls, involvement of higher/highest levels of customer service. Were talking about 20+hrs on the phone each month.

One time they were out of my medications, instead of saying anything, they just canceled the script. When we called, they stated the doctor canceled it. That went round & round before we got to the bottom of it. My doc wrote FIVE scripts for the same prescription.

Another time they were out of the generic, with no backorder date. So we requested an exception for brand name(which would also cost us 50%, but i need my medication, right?) or a local fill(which costs us 80 or 90%), well, the company approved it(took a week for caremark to send the request-which was only done when we called the company & asked when they would approve it...they stated they hadn't gotten it, then THEY called CM to get it & approve the request), then caremark delayed, delayed, delayed, &sent the generic 5-1/2w later....I was without necessary medications for 4-1/2wks, I was using a walker, falling several times a day, &couldn't even brush my hair(among other things).

When I am paying 100%(deductible period), theyre usually a bit better, once the deductible is reached th3y get worse, once I reach my out of pocket max, forget it, the games will reach fever pitch.

Additionally, they require prior authorization for many medications. These are only good for a set amount of time(1-12mos), the time they last can vary-I guess maybe my MS might go away, so this must be re-evaluated regularly-lol. This time a PA might last 6mos, but the next time only 1mos. However they do not provide you with these details, you find out when they don't send your script, you call, are routed through multiple layers of customer service to discover the problem....now another 3-4-7d to process that. Plus my docs office charges $25 everytime one needs to be submitted(this is more an annoyance than anything, but it definitely adds to the ""layers"")

Then there's the ""you can't have it"" list. An example are lidocaine patches. I can only have those if I have shingles. Doesn't matter that they improve my quality of life, nope, only for shingles. It's the same with Zofran. I take it because I have issues swallowing, but its a nausea medication...so unless I'm pregnant, or have a flu, I cannot have it. That one I have chosen to pay out of pocket at Costco so I can continue to eat & drink(vs gtube).

Then there's the ""that's not therapeutic""...I am on cymbalta(antidepressant)to help with pain, but if I take it daily, then I cannot sleep. So I take it every other day. If my doc writes the script for 15/mo, they will not fill it because its not ""therapeutic,"" so my doc has to write for 30, tell me to just write it every other day.

We have complained to the company that provides our insurance, they call Caremark who tries to blame me, I provide the company with proof that it is not me, Caremark assigned us a care coordinator who was more worthless than just about any agent we had spoken with....she would not return calls for WEEKS, she was the one that played games with the out of stock medication until they received the generic back in stock. It's a joke.

My doctors hate dealing with them, we hate them even more, but I have no choice. It's so bad that my husband had talked about changing jobs just to get away from them.

I have begun rationing & skipping doses of medications...its better to go one day/wk without medications...better to take 2doses per day instead of 3...than to be out for weeks at a time. This has absolutely affected both my health & quality of life(I am on many medications to treat the symptoms of MS, so things to control spasticity, shaking/tremors, pain, migraines, nerve function, bladder function, fatigue, heart, etc)

The worst part of all of this, i have PPMS(primary progressive, the worst type), at 15y, only 15% can still walk. At 20y, 5%. I am at 17y & am still mobile, but I truly feel that it is starting to slip away & I 100% believe CM is playing a MAJOR part in all of that. IF that were to happen, I will file a lawsuit.

I am not alone in any of this. Every person I know that has a chronic condition has a similar experience. Many folks talk about a class action suit. In the end, I really just want them to do better!! I just want my medications so I can take care of myself & my family!!

It's CONSTANT!! There's much MUCH more, that's just a small taste.

As an aside, we pay nearly 2k/mo for family insurance coverage. It's rather sickening","Many/most insurance plans don't allow ""maintenance medication"" to be filled any other way without a major penalty(basically they pay $50, you pay $500 type penalty).

They run out of medications, cancel scripts on a whim, &take FOREVER to fill scripts(my doc sends electronically, it takes 24-72h to get through processing, then another 48-72h to fill, then they mail it, the whole thing takes around 7-14days).

Because of the levels of bureaucracy in a company that size, everyone you speak to will tell you something different, some agents are great, some are awful. I went 28mos in a row with a mistake/issue EVERY MONTH. Those 28mos I received 23mos of medications to their delays and ineptitude....and that was WITH daily calls, involvement of higher/highest levels of customer service. Were talking about 20+hrs on the phone each month.

One time they were out of my medications, instead of saying anything, they just canceled the script. When we called, they stated the doctor canceled it. That went round & round before we got to the bottom of it. My doc wrote FIVE scripts for the same prescription.

Another time they were out of the generic, with no backorder date. So we requested an exception for brand name(which would also cost us 50%, but i need my medication, right?) or a local fill(which costs us 80 or 90%), well, the company approved it(took a week for caremark to send the request-which was only done when we called the company & asked when they would approve it...they stated they hadn't gotten it, then THEY called CM to get it & approve the request), then caremark delayed, delayed, delayed, &sent the generic 5-1/2w later....I was without necessary medications for 4-1/2wks, I was using a walker, falling several times a day, &couldn't even brush my hair(among other things).

There is literally historical data that backs up tariffs increase consumer prices. That's not a discussion, it is a fact. And yes the previous administration kept the tariffs imposed by Trump because tariffs aren't easy on the economy to apply nor remove since multiple businesses have to adapt to said tariff. Also, there is a difference between tariffs. There are tariffs applied to very specific things, then there are global tariffs like the ones proposed by Trump which will have massive ramifications on consumers. Again, data is out there on how tariffs affect consumer prices when they're applied to entire countries.

I'm not going to spell it out because you need to learn to research instead of just drinking the kool-aid. Businesses depend on imported goods. If there is a tariff then those same goods now cost substantially more to produce. That business isn't going to just eat that cost in their profit margin. They will raise prices. Those prices affect other businesses that rely on their goods, and they also raise their prices. Will it increase jobs? Of course. Will it decrease reliance on other nations? Of course. But at what cost? The cost the consumer pays. There is a reason why all nations do business globally. There is a cost if you stop doing business globally.

Insider trading occurs when individuals with a duty to keep non-public information confidential—such as a CFO or accountant—trade on that information. They can still trade, but they have blackout periods and must disclose their trading activities. However, I’m not subject to those blackout periods because I don’t have access to Tesla’s sales and revenue data before earnings. If I did have that information, I would need to avoid trading in the two weeks before and after earnings announcements. So, insider trading isn’t a concern for me since I only have access to publicly disclosed information, not confidential information.","Insider trading doesn’t apply to me because I don’t have any non-public information.

2024-11-08,KO,investing,post,1gmkoei,,,A Look at History: A Review of the 7 Bull Markets in U.S. Stocks Over the Past 50 Years,"A Look at History: A Review of the 7 Bull Markets in U.S. Stocks Over the Past 50 Years
Looking back at the history of U.S. stocks, all the bull and bear markets after the Great Depression, it is worthwhile for us to go like a history textbook to learn a little.
To rise 20% as the standard, the past 50 years a total of seven bull market, with the A shares of the bear long bull short different, U.S. stock history is a bull long bear short history, the following we review one by one.



1. 1970-1973:
Starting from the famous “Nifty Fifty”, the “ Pretty 50 ‘, the popular investment theme at that time was what we later knew as the ’Pretty 50”, which included a series of high-profile companies such as McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Polaroid, etc. At that time, these stocks were characterized by high earnings growth and high PEs. These companies included McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Polaroid, and a series of other high-profile companies, and at that time, these stocks were characterized by high performance growth, and at the same time, the PE was also very high. From a paper found online that specializes in the study of that time, we see that in 1972 Polaroid PE was 91 times, McDonald's was 86 times, and Coca-Cola was 48 times. Eventually, the bubble burst in 1973, when the PE of the S&P 500 was 18x

2. 1974-1980:
During that period in the 70's and 80's, inflation was stronger and interest rate levels went all the way up. in 1980, inflation was as high as 13.5% and interest rates were raised to 20%, a figure that might be unimaginable today. In the midst of all this raising of interest rates along the way, this last leg of the bull market came to an end when the PE of the S&P 500 was only 7.5

3. 1982-1987:
Another new cycle began, inflation was curbed, interest rates began a long downward spiral that continues to this day, and with various tax cuts, a new bull market was up. The five-year bull market lasted until Black Monday in 1987, when the broad market fell 22% in one day. In fact, the PE of the broad market at that time was not too high, 15 times PE. This crash was rather sudden, and there are also claims that the computerized trading model introduced at that time led to this rapid plunge. However, since then, the meltdown mechanism has been invented

4. 1987-1990:
The selloff brought on by Black Monday was quickly followed by a rally, a rallying bull of sorts as the broader market accumulated a 65% gain by 1990. By 1990, interest rates once again stayed high because of the rising oil prices at the time, and the 10% interest rate level was never seen again for 30 years after that. At that time, the broad market PE was 15 times, which was not too high, and the index decline lasted only three months before it was over

5. 1990-2000：
The 90's were good and beautiful, and the 10-year-long bull market was about to kick off. This decade the U.S. economy is good, Windows95, Windows98, Yahoo, the Internet has brought unlimited imagination, the feeling is not immediately into the new century, but into the new world. Ten years, the general market rose more than 4 times, are epic. Eventually the internet bubble bubbled, Amazon went from a high of 100 bucks, down to a few bucks, while the S&P 500 lost 50% of its value

6. 2002-2007:
The low interest rate level and zero down payment to buy a house, if you are interested, you can go and watch the movie “The Big Short” again, which describes it in a very easy-to-understand way. You can buy a house with no money, and when you do, home prices go up, and you feel happier to spend money when you have money, and the guys get high. Wall Street has repackaged these subprime zero-down mortgages into a product that is complicated for everyone to understand, but looks like an oxymoron, so how can you not make money? The farce had to end, and it did, with the 2008 subprime crisis, which left 8 million people unemployed, 6 million homeless, and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression in the U.S. Between 2007 and 2009, the S&P 500 lost nearly 60% of its value, Citibank lost 97% of its market capitalization, and Lehman Brothers went bankrupt.

7. 2009-Present:
After the subprime mortgage crisis cleared up, U.S. stocks had one of the longest bull markets in history. It was also an era when large U.S. technology companies became stock market leaders. more than a decade after the release of the iPhone in 2007, Apple became the world's largest company by market capitalization. Microsoft, which had almost been forgotten, returned to the top of its market capitalization after transforming itself into cloud computing. And then there's Amazon, left over from the last Internet bubble, and Google, the Google created during the last Internet bubble, have grown to become giants with market capitalizations of over $2 trillion dollars

 The next time?","Looking back at the history of U.S. stocks, all the bull and bear markets after the Great Depression, it is worthwhile for us to go like a history textbook to learn a little.
To rise 20% as the standard, the past 50 years a total of seven bull market, with the A shares of the bear long bull short different, U.S. stock history is a bull long bear short history, the following we review one by one.



1. 1970-1973:
Starting from the famous “Nifty Fifty”, the “ Pretty 50 ‘, the popular investment theme at that time was what we later knew as the ’Pretty 50”, which included a series of high-profile companies such as McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Polaroid, etc. At that time, these stocks were characterized by high earnings growth and high PEs. These companies included McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Polaroid, and a series of other high-profile companies, and at that time, these stocks were characterized by high performance growth, and at the same time, the PE was also very high. From a paper found online that specializes in the study of that time, we see that in 1972 Polaroid PE was 91 times, McDonald's was 86 times, and Coca-Cola was 48 times. Eventually, the bubble burst in 1973, when the PE of the S&P 500 was 18x

2. 1974-1980:
During that period in the 70's and 80's, inflation was stronger and interest rate levels went all the way up. in 1980, inflation was as high as 13.5% and interest rates were raised to 20%, a figure that might be unimaginable today. In the midst of all this raising of interest rates along the way, this last leg of the bull market came to an end when the PE of the S&P 500 was only 7.5

3. 1982-1987:
Another new cycle began, inflation was curbed, interest rates began a long downward spiral that continues to this day, and with various tax cuts, a new bull market was up. The five-year bull market lasted until Black Monday in 1987, when the broad market fell 22% in one day. In fact, the PE of the broad market at that time was not too high, 15 times PE. This crash was rather sudden, and there are also claims that the computerized trading model introduced at that time led to this rapid plunge. However, since then, the meltdown mechanism has been invented

4. 1987-1990:
The selloff brought on by Black Monday was quickly followed by a rally, a rallying bull of sorts as the broader market accumulated a 65% gain by 1990. By 1990, interest rates once again stayed high because of the rising oil prices at the time, and the 10% interest rate level was never seen again for 30 years after that. At that time, the broad market PE was 15 times, which was not too high, and the index decline lasted only three months before it was over

5. 1990-2000：
The 90's were good and beautiful, and the 10-year-long bull market was about to kick off. This decade the U.S. economy is good, Windows95, Windows98, Yahoo, the Internet has brought unlimited imagination, the feeling is not immediately into the new century, but into the new world. Ten years, the general market rose more than 4 times, are epic. Eventually the internet bubble bubbled, Amazon went from a high of 100 bucks, down to a few bucks, while the S&P 500 lost 50% of its value

6. 2002-2007:
The low interest rate level and zero down payment to buy a house, if you are interested, you can go and watch the movie “The Big Short” again, which describes it in a very easy-to-understand way. You can buy a house with no money, and when you do, home prices go up, and you feel happier to spend money when you have money, and the guys get high. Wall Street has repackaged these subprime zero-down mortgages into a product that is complicated for everyone to understand, but looks like an oxymoron, so how can you not make money? The farce had to end, and it did, with the 2008 subprime crisis, which left 8 million people unemployed, 6 million homeless, and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression in the U.S. Between 2007 and 2009, the S&P 500 lost nearly 60% of its value, Citibank lost 97% of its market capitalization, and Lehman Brothers went bankrupt.

7. 2009-Present:
After the subprime mortgage crisis cleared up, U.S. stocks had one of the longest bull markets in history. It was also an era when large U.S. technology companies became stock market leaders. more than a decade after the release of the iPhone in 2007, Apple became the world's largest company by market capitalization. Microsoft, which had almost been forgotten, returned to the top of its market capitalization after transforming itself into cloud computing. And then there's Amazon, left over from the last Internet bubble, and Google, the Google created during the last Internet bubble, have grown to become giants with market capitalizations of over $2 trillion dollars

Using a new trading system called EMS. 

Rules are below:

EMS (Enhanced Mechanic System) Quick Guide: Rules to Follow

The EMS (Enhanced Mechanic System) is a straightforward strategy focused on support, resistance, and wedge patterns (flags with a “flagpole”). This approach reduces noise and emphasizes price action and volume for high-probability setups.

1. Trade A+ Setups Only

	•	Rule: Only trade setups that meet strict A+ criteria, focusing on clean support, resistance, and flag patterns.
	•	A+ Setup Definition: Clear support/resistance level, valid wedge pattern with a flagpole (strong move followed by consolidation), and volume confirms the setup.
	•	Why: Focusing on high-quality setups increases the probability of success.

2. Trade Based on Charts, Not PnL

	•	Rule: Make trade decisions based on the chart pattern, not profit and loss.
	•	Why: Focusing on PnL leads to emotional decisions. Staying chart-focused ensures disciplined trading.

3. Set Stop Loss Based on the Chart, Not a Fixed Percentage

	•	Rule: Set your stop loss according to the chart pattern. For example:
	•	In a long trade, set the stop below key support or bottom of the wedge.
	•	In a short trade, set the stop above resistance or top of the pattern.
	•	Avoid Fixed % Stops: Use the chart structure for guidance.
	•	Why: Chart-based stops let the trade develop naturally without premature stops.

4. Trade Specific Timeframes Only

	•	Market Hours: Only trade during:
	•	9:30 AM - 11:00 AM EST (Morning Session)
	•	2:45 PM - 4:00 PM EST (Afternoon Session)
	•	Timeframes Used: Stick to the 30-minute and 1-hour charts.
	•	No Pre-Market or Post-Market Data: Ignore pre-market and post-market price movements as they are often low-volume and less reliable for EMS patterns.
	•	Why: These trading windows capture predictable price action and minimize risk, while regular market hours ensure more reliable data.

5. Do Not Trade Earnings or Major News

	•	Rule: Avoid trading during earnings or major news releases.
	•	Why: Earnings and news events lead to unpredictable swings, increasing risk.

6. Focus on Big Tech and Mega Cap Stocks

	•	Stocks to Trade: Stick to Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), Google (GOOGL), and other mega-cap stocks.
	•	Why: These stocks provide the liquidity and volume needed for EMS trading.

7. Flag Patterns and the “Flagpole”

	•	What to Look For: Flags are consolidations following a strong price movement (flagpole).
	•	Entry: Look for a breakout from the flag pattern for a clear entry.
	•	Why: These patterns lead to reliable breakouts, offering favorable opportunities.

8. No Indicators

	•	Rule: Avoid using indicators like EMAs, VWAP, Level 2, or others. The only exception is volume.
	•	Why: EMS relies on price action and volume only, avoiding unnecessary noise.

9. Follow a Structured Routine

	•	Pre-Market: Create a watchlist of 3-5 potential trades with strong support/resistance or flag setups.
	•	Post-Market: Journal your trades to evaluate setups, entries, exits, emotions, and lessons learned.
	•	Why: Consistent routines build discipline and improve trading clarity.

10. Discipline is Key

	•	Stick to the Plan: Do not adjust stops or take trades that don’t meet A+ criteria.
	•	Limit Number of Trades: Focus on quality over quantity.
	•	Control Emotions: Maintain a calm approach, even if the trade moves against you. Trust your analysis.","Using a new trading system called EMS.

1. **Find a 100x leverage option or certificate** on an index. With this leverage, a 1% move in your favor doubles your money.
2. **Repeat this six times in a row successfully**: Starting with $32,000, six correct bets would bring you up to $2,048,000. The chance of six consecutive correct calls is around 1 in 64.

For comparison, you could think of this as a casino strategy:

* **Roulette**: Going all-in on red or black in roulette doubles your money on a win. Guessing correctly six times in a row would also bring $32,000 to $2,048,000, though your odds here are worse (1 in 103.5) due to the zero on the wheel.
* **Straight Number Bet**: Betting on a single number (1 in 37 chance) would pay 36x your money. Starting with $32,000, winning just once would yield $1,152,000, so your odds here aren’t much worse than with leveraged index betting.

For fun, I tried this strategy on a smaller scale, starting with €100 to see if I could guess correctly 14 times in a row, which would theoretically make me a millionaire with a 1 in 16,384 chance. It didn’t work out—no surprise there—but it was an interesting experiment in probability!

There are also even higher leverage options out there. For example, I found 275x leverage for shorting the S&P 500, where only three successful trades could turn $32,000 into about $1.687 million (a 1 in 8 chance theoretically). However, such high leverage is extremely risky, as these are often set just a few points away from a “knockout” point, meaning a small adverse move could trigger a total loss.

In the end, strategies like this are much closer to gambling than investing and come with a very high chance of total loss. So, use this info with caution!","I have a high-risk strategy with a theoretical 1 in 64 chance of success in a volatile market, but it could easily lead to a total loss if it fails.

2024-11-08,KO,wallstreetbets,post,1gmlw0m,,,A Look at History: A Review of the 7 Bull Markets in U.S. Stocks Over the Past 50 Years,"A Look at History: A Review of the 7 Bull Markets in U.S. Stocks Over the Past 50 Years
Looking back at the history of U.S. stocks, all the bull and bear markets after the Great Depression, it is worthwhile for us to go like a history textbook to learn a little.
To rise 20% as the standard, the past 50 years a total of seven bull market, with the A shares of the bear long bull short different, U.S. stock history is a bull long bear short history, the following we review one by one.


1. 1970-1973:
Starting from the famous “Nifty Fifty”, the “ Pretty 50 ‘, the popular investment theme at that time was what we later knew as the ’Pretty 50”, which included a series of high-profile companies such as McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Polaroid, etc. At that time, these stocks were characterized by high earnings growth and high PEs. These companies included McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Polaroid, and a series of other high-profile companies, and at that time, these stocks were characterized by high performance growth, and at the same time, the PE was also very high. From a paper found online that specializes in the study of that time, we see that in 1972 Polaroid PE was 91 times, McDonald's was 86 times, and Coca-Cola was 48 times. Eventually, the bubble burst in 1973, when the PE of the S&P 500 was 18x

2. 1974-1980:
During that period in the 70's and 80's, inflation was stronger and interest rate levels went all the way up. in 1980, inflation was as high as 13.5% and interest rates were raised to 20%, a figure that might be unimaginable today. In the midst of all this raising of interest rates along the way, this last leg of the bull market came to an end when the PE of the S&P 500 was only 7.5

3. 1982-1987:
Another new cycle began, inflation was curbed, interest rates began a long downward spiral that continues to this day, and with various tax cuts, a new bull market was up. The five-year bull market lasted until Black Monday in 1987, when the broad market fell 22% in one day. In fact, the PE of the broad market at that time was not too high, 15 times PE. This crash was rather sudden, and there are also claims that the computerized trading model introduced at that time led to this rapid plunge. However, since then, the meltdown mechanism has been invented

4. 1987-1990:
The selloff brought on by Black Monday was quickly followed by a rally, a rallying bull of sorts as the broader market accumulated a 65% gain by 1990. By 1990, interest rates once again stayed high because of the rising oil prices at the time, and the 10% interest rate level was never seen again for 30 years after that. At that time, the broad market PE was 15 times, which was not too high, and the index decline lasted only three months before it was over

5. 1990-2000：
The 90's were good and beautiful, and the 10-year-long bull market was about to kick off. This decade the U.S. economy is good, Windows95, Windows98, Yahoo, the Internet has brought unlimited imagination, the feeling is not immediately into the new century, but into the new world. Ten years, the general market rose more than 4 times, are epic. Eventually the internet bubble bubbled, Amazon went from a high of 100 bucks, down to a few bucks, while the S&P 500 lost 50% of its value

6. 2002-2007:
The low interest rate level and zero down payment to buy a house, if you are interested, you can go and watch the movie “The Big Short” again, which describes it in a very easy-to-understand way. You can buy a house with no money, and when you do, home prices go up, and you feel happier to spend money when you have money, and the guys get high. Wall Street has repackaged these subprime zero-down mortgages into a product that is complicated for everyone to understand, but looks like an oxymoron, so how can you not make money? The farce had to end, and it did, with the 2008 subprime crisis, which left 8 million people unemployed, 6 million homeless, and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression in the U.S. Between 2007 and 2009, the S&P 500 lost nearly 60% of its value, Citibank lost 97% of its market capitalization, and Lehman Brothers went bankrupt.

7. 2009-Present:
After the subprime mortgage crisis cleared up, U.S. stocks had one of the longest bull markets in history. It was also an era when large U.S. technology companies became stock market leaders. more than a decade after the release of the iPhone in 2007, Apple became the world's largest company by market capitalization. Microsoft, which had almost been forgotten, returned to the top of its market capitalization after transforming itself into cloud computing. And then there's Amazon, left over from the last Internet bubble, and Google, the Google created during the last Internet bubble, have grown to become giants with market capitalizations of over $2 trillion dollars

 The next time?","Looking back at the history of U.S. stocks, all the bull and bear markets after the Great Depression, it is worthwhile for us to go like a history textbook to learn a little.
To rise 20% as the standard, the past 50 years a total of seven bull market, with the A shares of the bear long bull short different, U.S. stock history is a bull long bear short history, the following we review one by one.


1. 1970-1973:
Starting from the famous “Nifty Fifty”, the “ Pretty 50 ‘, the popular investment theme at that time was what we later knew as the ’Pretty 50”, which included a series of high-profile companies such as McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Polaroid, etc. At that time, these stocks were characterized by high earnings growth and high PEs. These companies included McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Polaroid, and a series of other high-profile companies, and at that time, these stocks were characterized by high performance growth, and at the same time, the PE was also very high. From a paper found online that specializes in the study of that time, we see that in 1972 Polaroid PE was 91 times, McDonald's was 86 times, and Coca-Cola was 48 times. Eventually, the bubble burst in 1973, when the PE of the S&P 500 was 18x

2. 1974-1980:
During that period in the 70's and 80's, inflation was stronger and interest rate levels went all the way up. in 1980, inflation was as high as 13.5% and interest rates were raised to 20%, a figure that might be unimaginable today. In the midst of all this raising of interest rates along the way, this last leg of the bull market came to an end when the PE of the S&P 500 was only 7.5

3. 1982-1987:
Another new cycle began, inflation was curbed, interest rates began a long downward spiral that continues to this day, and with various tax cuts, a new bull market was up. The five-year bull market lasted until Black Monday in 1987, when the broad market fell 22% in one day. In fact, the PE of the broad market at that time was not too high, 15 times PE. This crash was rather sudden, and there are also claims that the computerized trading model introduced at that time led to this rapid plunge. However, since then, the meltdown mechanism has been invented

4. 1987-1990:
The selloff brought on by Black Monday was quickly followed by a rally, a rallying bull of sorts as the broader market accumulated a 65% gain by 1990. By 1990, interest rates once again stayed high because of the rising oil prices at the time, and the 10% interest rate level was never seen again for 30 years after that. At that time, the broad market PE was 15 times, which was not too high, and the index decline lasted only three months before it was over

5. 1990-2000：
The 90's were good and beautiful, and the 10-year-long bull market was about to kick off. This decade the U.S. economy is good, Windows95, Windows98, Yahoo, the Internet has brought unlimited imagination, the feeling is not immediately into the new century, but into the new world. Ten years, the general market rose more than 4 times, are epic. Eventually the internet bubble bubbled, Amazon went from a high of 100 bucks, down to a few bucks, while the S&P 500 lost 50% of its value

6. 2002-2007:
The low interest rate level and zero down payment to buy a house, if you are interested, you can go and watch the movie “The Big Short” again, which describes it in a very easy-to-understand way. You can buy a house with no money, and when you do, home prices go up, and you feel happier to spend money when you have money, and the guys get high. Wall Street has repackaged these subprime zero-down mortgages into a product that is complicated for everyone to understand, but looks like an oxymoron, so how can you not make money?

2024-11-08,KO,wallstreetbets,post,1gmlv00,,,ACHR Aviation - Primed to Soar Past Joby?,"ACHR Aviation - Primed to Soar Past Joby?
Alright degenerates, strap in. To me after this latest earnings call and shareholder letter, it’s clear ACHR Aviation ($ACHR) is on the verge of a major lift-off. Given Joby trades at 3x the market cap of ACHR, I think we’re looking at huge untapped upside with ACHR’s stock. I’m breaking down the top headlines for anyone looking to go deep on this and see why:
1. Building Production Aircraft
Archer was very specific to call out that moving forward, they are building piloted, type design production aircraft for testing and early commercial deployment. It was a thinly veiled jab at Joby who noted in response to analyst questions on their call their earnings call yesterday that all the aircraft they’re currently working on are still prototypes. This is a very big deal. This point alone kind of shatters the current perception that Joby is ahead. Joby has rolled out a few more aircraft than Archer, but it sounds like all of them are still prototypes that are not piloted and are intended to be used for demonstration flights, which is an odd decision at this stage in the game. Whereas, Archer is working on piloted production aircraft that will be used for testing and actual commercial deployment. This leads into the next point…
2. Certification Progress 
While Joby’s been working through certifications and made their own progress report chart that oddly doesn’t map to the FAA’s 4-phase cert chart, ACHR just revealed they are done with phases 1 and 2, have nearly completed phase 3 and are already chipping away at the 4th and final phase of the FAA’s type cert program. This means ACHR might get certified and be commercially viable sooner than anyone expected which is crazy given Joby started a decade ahead of ACHR and ACHR has already caught them. We’re waiting on more specifics, but let’s just say the needle is moving quickly here based on what they just revealed in yesterday’s call which seems to be why they are moving forward with building piloted production aircraft instead of more non-piloted prototype aircraft. 
3. Scale Manufacturing 
Success for this industry will be all about scale. Building a great prototype aircraft is cool, but if you can’t manufacture it at scale, that’s a big problem. ACHR is objectively WAY ahead of Joby and the rest of the industry on this front. ACHR’s high-volume manufacturing facility in Georgia is nearly complete. It takes years to select a site, break ground, build a facility and then ramp up production, so the rest of the pack has a lot of catch up to do to get to where ACHR is today on this front. It looks like ACHR timed this right as they said the UAE is making a big run at being the first market to go live with air taxis as soon as Q4’2025. Per my first point, this means ACHR will be in position to have the first handful of piloted production aircraft rolling off the line and ready to deliver. It doesn’t look like anyone else in the industry will be able to say the same. Like I’ve already said, Joby has been at this game a full decade longer than ACHR, but they haven’t even started construction on their high-volume facility in Ohio. ACHR’s head-start in production capacity could be the edge they need to mass-produce at scale before anyone else and hit the ground running in the U.S and abroad. Which leads to the next point…
4. Commercial Launch 
ACHR’s launch timeline doesn’t appear to be restricted by waiting for certification from the FAA anymore because the UAE sounds like they’re getting very bullish on being the first to have air taxis fly commercially in their airspace - with Archer as the lead option for reasons stated above. Everything’s shaping up for an exciting 2025 for Archer. ACHR laid out a super pragmatic 3 step launch plan of how they’re approaching launches with partners that includes in-market piloted demonstration flights followed by piloted market survey flights carrying local passengers before a full market launch. Others have done demo flights, but none of those are with pilots on board, which looks cool, but doesn’t mean much from a market launch and real operations perspective. If you put all these pieces together, it looks like ACHR is on track to be first in the air with paying customers… 
3. Japan Expansion
The cherry on top…ACHR just revealed a massive new move into Japan via a deal with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo for up to 100 eVTOL aircraft. Oddly, the news broke in Japan first a few weeks ago on the down low, but it’s about time we amplify it here. NIKKO, which owns 10 million shares, may be behind an ACHR and Japan Airlines’ deal. Japan is serious about the eVTOL game, and with its high density, congested cities, and love for tech innovation, this market is like striking gold. It also includes piloted demonstration flights at the World Expo and ACHR’s announcement notes they’re already working with the regulator on the certification front. Strong government support for eVTOL in Japan is another encouraging sign that this market shows a lot of promise. 
Wrap Up
Joby may have started a decade ahead, but ACHR’s business strategy focused on commercialization and all the moves they’ve made lately? It looks like they may have just passed Joby this quarter. If you project ACHR's progress and momentum forward, it's hard to imagine they won't be at the forefront of urban air mobility which is wild because Joby still has a market cap that’s 3x higher than ACHRs. Time to get on board now before this stock takes off! 
TL;DR: Archer is building piloted production aircraft and Joby is building prototypes that are remotely operated. With great certification progress, a manufacturing facility on the brink, Japan expansion, and launch plans materializing, ACHR's looking like it low key just passed Joby and took the lead in the eVTOL industry’s race to market.","Alright degenerates, strap in.

Alright degenerates, strap in. To me after this latest earnings call and shareholder letter, it’s clear ACHR Aviation ($ACHR) is on the verge of a major lift-off. Given Joby trades at 3x the market cap of ACHR, I think we’re looking at huge untapped upside with ACHR’s stock. I’m breaking down the top headlines for anyone looking to go deep on this and see why:

Building Production Aircraft

Archer was very specific to call out that moving forward, they are building piloted, type design production aircraft for testing and early commercial deployment. It was a thinly veiled jab at Joby who noted in response to analyst questions on their call their earnings call yesterday that all the aircraft they’re currently working on are still prototypes. This is a very big deal. This point alone kind of shatters the current perception that Joby is ahead. Joby has rolled out a few more aircraft than Archer, but it sounds like all of them are still prototypes that are not piloted and are intended to be used for demonstration flights, which is an odd decision at this stage in the game. Whereas, Archer is working on piloted production aircraft that will be used for testing and actual commercial deployment. This leads into the next point…

Certification Progress

While Joby’s been working through certifications and made their own progress report chart that oddly doesn’t map to the FAA’s 4-phase cert chart, ACHR just revealed they are done with phases 1 and 2, have nearly completed phase 3 and are already chipping away at the 4th and final phase of the FAA’s type cert program. This means ACHR might get certified and be commercially viable sooner than anyone expected which is crazy given Joby started a decade ahead of ACHR and ACHR has already caught them. We’re waiting on more specifics, but let’s just say the needle is moving quickly here based on what they just revealed in yesterday’s call which seems to be why they are moving forward with building piloted production aircraft instead of more non-piloted prototype aircraft. 

Scale Manufacturing 

Success for this industry will be all about scale. Building a great prototype aircraft is cool, but if you can’t manufacture it at scale, that’s a big problem. ACHR is objectively WAY ahead of Joby and the rest of the industry on this front. ACHR’s high-volume manufacturing facility in Georgia is nearly complete. It takes years to select a site, break ground, build a facility and then ramp up production, so the rest of the pack has a lot of catch up to do to get to where ACHR is today on this front. It looks like ACHR timed this right as they said the UAE is making a big run at being the first market to go live with air taxis as soon as Q4’2025. Per my first point, this means ACHR will be in position to have the first handful of *piloted production aircraft* rolling off the line and ready to deliver. It doesn’t look like anyone else in the industry will be able to say the same. Like I’ve already said, Joby has been at this game a full decade longer than ACHR, but they haven’t even started construction on their high-volume facility in Ohio. ACHR’s head-start in production capacity could be the edge they need to mass-produce at scale before anyone else and hit the ground running in the U.S and abroad. Which leads to the next point…

Commercial Launch

ACHR’s launch timeline doesn’t appear to be restricted by waiting for certification from the FAA anymore because the UAE sounds like they’re getting very bullish on being the first to have air taxis fly commercially in their airspace - with Archer as the lead option for reasons stated above. Everything’s shaping up for an exciting 2025 for Archer. ACHR laid out a super pragmatic 3 step launch plan of how they’re approaching launches with partners that includes in-market piloted demonstration flights followed by piloted market survey flights carrying local passengers before a full market launch. Others have done demo flights, but none of those are with pilots on board, which looks cool, but doesn’t mean much from a market launch and real operations perspective. If you put all these pieces together, it looks like ACHR is on track to be first in the air with paying customers… 

Japan Expansion

The cherry on top…ACHR just revealed a massive new move into Japan via a deal with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo for up to 100 eVTOL aircraft. Oddly, the news broke in Japan first a few weeks ago on the down low, but it’s about time we amplify it here. NIKKO, which owns 10 million shares, may be behind an ACHR and Japan Airlines’ deal. Japan is serious about the eVTOL game, and with its high density, congested cities, and love for tech innovation, this market is like striking gold. It also includes piloted demonstration flights at the World Expo and ACHR’s announcement notes they’re already working with the regulator on the certification front. Strong government support for eVTOL in Japan is another encouraging sign that this market shows a lot of promise. 

Wrap Up

Joby may have started a decade ahead, but ACHR’s business strategy focused on commercialization and all the moves they’ve made lately? It looks like they may have just passed Joby this quarter. If you project ACHR's progress and momentum forward, it's hard to imagine they won't be at the forefront of urban air mobility which is wild because Joby still has a market cap that’s 3x higher than ACHRs. Time to get on board now before this stock takes off! 

TL;DR: Archer is building piloted production aircraft and Joby is building prototypes that are remotely operated. With great certification progress, a manufacturing facility on the brink, Japan expansion, and launch plans materializing, ACHR's looking like it low key just passed Joby and took the lead in the eVTOL industry’s race to market.","Alright degenerates, strap in.

2024-11-10,KO,wallstreetbets,post,1gnnp6r,,,An Overlooked Catalyst in the Market Could Bring Massive Upside - Here’s What I’m Seeing,"An Overlooked Catalyst in the Market Could Bring Massive Upside - Here’s What I’m Seeing


Alright, everyone, I want to take a step back from the noise and bring some serious analysis to the table here. After some extensive research, I’ve come across an under-the-radar opportunity that, if I’m right, could yield significant upside. I’m talking about an overlooked catalyst that has the potential to shift the market sentiment for this specific play in a big way, and I want to walk you through exactly what I’ve been seeing.

1. The Catalyst That No One is Talking About

The financial markets are incredibly efficient most of the time, but every now and then, something slips through the cracks—especially in the shadow of high-profile headlines. Right now, I’m seeing a mispriced asset driven by a confluence of factors that most investors are either ignoring or outright missing. Imagine a setup where even a slight trigger could lead to massive price action – that’s what I’m seeing with this ticker.

Here’s a little teaser: it’s in a sector that’s been on the back burner due to recent economic conditions, and while everyone is focused on high-profile industries, this one is poised to benefit from a unique set of circumstances.

2. The Technicals – A Set-Up I Haven’t Seen in a While

Technically speaking, the chart is in a favorable setup with a base of support that’s held consistently, and, interestingly, we’re approaching what could be a key breakout level if it holds. I’m seeing a strong confluence of support levels converging near a pivot point. The key indicators like RSI, MACD, and EMA trends have been showing momentum that could easily trigger a breakout – the perfect storm for a massive uptrend.

3. The Fundamentals – Strong Financial Backbone

I’ve dug deep into their balance sheet, cash flow, and recent quarterly performance. The company’s fundamentals are, in my opinion, undervalued based on the price-to-earnings ratio, EV/EBITDA, and free cash flow yield compared to their peer group. Additionally, the management team has been on a strategic initiative to reduce overhead costs and strengthen the balance sheet, a move that typically positions companies to capitalize on positive catalysts.

And here’s the kicker: institutional ownership has been quietly increasing. When you see hedge funds and major institutions accumulating, it’s typically a sign that they’re betting on long-term growth. I’ve been tracking filings, and the steady increase in institutional stakes over the past quarters signals that they may know something we don’t – yet.

4. The Macro Outlook – Why Now?

Macro factors are aligning in a way that could accelerate this play. Interest rate shifts, new regulations, and changes in consumer behavior are all playing into the hands of this sector. In particular, we’re seeing a tightening market in some raw materials essential to this company’s products, which increases their pricing power and margins, a factor the broader market seems to have ignored. The macro environment is amplifying their competitive advantage right when they need it.

5. My Prediction

I think we’re on the edge of something big. When a company with a strong foundation, an overlooked sector, and a tight technical setup aligns with favorable macro factors, it’s usually a sign of high upside potential. If this ticker moves past the resistance level I mentioned, there’s a legitimate chance we’ll see a rapid movement. If this pans out, we could be looking at triple-digit percentage gains over the next few quarters.


---

Now, this isn’t financial advice – as always, do your own DD. I’m just sharing what I see based on my analysis, but I wouldn’t be putting this much time into writing this post if I wasn’t seeing serious potential here. Stay tuned, and I’ll be following up as new data rolls in.","

And you bet the bots from China and Russia will absolutely be fanning this incredibly destabilizing shit, same as the Chinese/NoKo bots did for Korea. But who knows, you Americans are much less like lemmings than Koreans because of your individualism, geographic expanse & racial diversity.

As for your portfolio - no puts on luxury brands, that's not how it played out in Korea. Try shorting dating, marriage, or child related stuff, because Korea's birth rate took a nose dive when all this stuff started.

Imagine your sink breaks. Normally, you’d spend a lot of time finding and reaching out to service providers, checking reviews across platforms, and negotiating prices starting from their quotes.

For service providers:

For service providers, especially if you’ve just graduated trade school or want to freelance for extra income, getting started often means spending years building a reputation before customers reach out.

Anyone betting against Kohls (especially before the holiday season) is OUT OF THEIR MINDS.

*for transparency I've not been in one for years, but a few things you bros on here aren't factoring matter in the short term.

1. We women like to try our clothes on in person. Why? Upsizing. There's  zero consistency in women's clothing because companies realized women are more likely to buy clothes from a store that makes them ""feel skinny"". A size 4 from one store will be size 2 or 0, and so on. It's impossible to even guess what size I am at this point.  

 2. Yes, it's cheaper to buy from Shien but is it more convenient? No. Why? Because as a woman you WILL be returning at least one article of clothing (see above). 

4. Holidays. When I still had a living family to spend the holidays with (RIP everyone) my mom and I would go Holiday shopping as a bonding thing. That's gonna continue to happen as long as stores are still open and Americans have money. 

5. Boomers and coupons. It's black Friday every day at Kolhs. Until the elders die off, department stores shall remain. When the last boomer dies so shall your local department store. Don't underestimate how many old people don't know how to use a computer.

* Gold (“Au”) poured for the period totaled 20,110 oz.
* Cash operating cost of $585 per oz sold and all-in sustaining cost (“AISC”) of $766 per oz sold.
* Revenue of $40.2 million (Q3 2023: $36.6 million).
* EBITDA of $27.4 million (Q3 2023: $10.5 million).
* Net profit of $17.5 million (Q3 2023: $0.9 million).
* Senior debt facility reduced to $3.9 million as of September 30, 2024. This debt is scheduled to be fully repaid by the end of Q4 2024.
* Transitioned from a net debt position of $2.7 million on June 30, 2024 to a net cash position of $2.7 million on September 30, 2024.

**Operational Profile**

* The priority of the Company’s exploration strategy is extending the Segilola mine life through delineation of potential additional underground resources at Segilola. An initial 12-hole drilling programme continued during the period with initial positive drill results received from the first two holes of 3.0 meters (“m”) grading 11.24g/t Au from 294m and 1.5m grading 3.22g/t Au from 269m.
* The remaining Pre-Feasibility Study (""PFS"") and Mineral Resource Estimate update workstreams are being completed, with a target completion in Q4 2024. Currently, estimated total reserves at the Douta project in Senegal total 1.78 million gold ounces at 1.2 g/tAu.
* RC drilling activities around the Makosa deposit were completed during the period. The programme was focused on increasing the percentage of oxide resources at the Makosa East Prospect, which runs parallel to the main Makosa mineralized trend and is additional to the current mineral resource. Additional infill drilling was completed at the Makosa North, Mansa and Maka prospects.
* During the quarter, Thor expanded its operations into Cote d’Ivoire following the signing of a binding agreement with Endeavour Mining Corporation to acquire a 100% interest in the Guitry Gold Project for $100,000 in cash and a 2% Net Smelter Royalty. Guitry is an advanced exploration project characterized by numerous gold-in-soil geochemical anomalies that have only been partially drill tested by the previous explorers. Some of the drill results include 1m grading at 12.03 g/tAu, 12m at 10.4g/tAu, 16m at 7.90g/tAu, 2m at 6.97 g/tAu, 4m at 5.73 g/tAu, 3m at 4.74 g/tAu, 16m at 2.25g/tAu, and 24m at 2.02g/tAu.

From my Understanding the US has basically sold Taiwan whatever they wanted with some advice on what is the best bang for their buck.

Trump has a made it a point that he is unhappy with really any country that doesn’t spend money on defense because the US Military has acted as the world’s police since WW2. (Whether you think they should or not is irrelevant).

He got mad at Germany for example because every NATO nation was supposed to spend a X% on military of their budget/GDP whatever.

I think that is more of his point .

I am reading about the restrictions which seem to stem out of the effort to delay or prevent China from getting the really cutting edge stuff and they are complying but it seems more out of “we don’t want to piss off the US”  versus any actual legal authority. Sure the stock is listed on NYSE but it’s an ADR and not an American company. So I’m little confused there. 

As for China. I’m sure there is *intent* but like NK it’s been a lot of posturing for the people.  Is it possible? Sure. Do I think it’s really going to happen? No. But I also didn’t think Putin would be dumb enough to invade Ukraine. 🤷‍♂️. I do think the difference here is that if China does something to Taiwan, they are immediately going to wake up South Korea, Japan, and probably the Philippines.  If fact a lot of the JSDF build up has been justified by Chinese aggression in the area. 

I don’t think it’s a matter of restraint but lack of capability. For instance they just got 1 working aircraft carrier, with the other still being worked on. They have zero military experience. The time to have “taken” back Taiwan was like right after WW2 and they have been stomping their feet ever since. 

TSM is essential to the West so from at least a business standpoint I see zero reason Trump will make their life miserable especially if they have/ are investing billions in Arizona  hopefully someone if not himself will make that incredibly clear to him","That’s okay.

2024-11-11,KO,stocks,comment,1gomnhh,lwnsl9e,t3_1gomnhh,,"Here's something that many well-run venture-funded startups do: once they get to a repeatable revenue model and know that they will reach profitability if they just keep doing what they're doing, they time their IPO to be roughly 2 quarters prior to hitting that point.  This allows them to price an IPO favorably and have the employee/insider lockout expire at around the same time they report their first profitable quarter.

A lot of naive traders will look at an IPO stock and think, ""Oh, this is super risky, they aren't even profitable yet.""  This is by design.  Ideally, they look like a promising business that is not without risk, and you have to look at the trend line of their gross vs net revenues, and whether it looks like their internal expenses and COGS are such that they will become profitable within the next year.  With well-run companies (i.e. competent financial department and underwriters who know how markets work), they will deliberately time the first profitable quarter to occur roughly two quarters after the IPO.

(caveat: a lot of things can interfere with this, like unexpected market movements and unanticipated macroeconomic dislocations, but given a steady market this is generally what companies and underwriters like to do)

If you are wondering how RDDT can be profitable, think about the following:

\- text-heavy site (low bandwidth operational costs)

\- most content generated by users (lowers operational cost)

\- distributed and motivated moderators (lowers operational cost)

\- advertising (makes money serving to many low-cost pageviews)

\- AI companies paying to learn (makes money)

Reddit is one of the largest actually-useful-content sites on the internet.  That by itself is a moat.  Would-be competitors face an uphill battle: it's easier to just make a subreddit, customize, and moderate it.

Of course there's risk, but the main question is: is it undervalued?  Do a lot of people (like you perhaps) look at this site and not realize that all the above factors make it enormously valuable?  If so, then it's probably undervalued and as time goes on the price will rise as the market realizes this.

Once upon a time, in the golden age of department stores, Kohl's was the go-to destination for anyone seeking a reasonably priced blender, a pair of socks, and perhaps a lawn gnome—all in one trip. But alas, those days are fading faster than the color on a clearance-rack shirt after one wash. Let's dive into the hilariously inevitable downfall of Kohl's.

In a world where you can order a drone to deliver your toothpaste within two hours, Kohl's seems as cutting-edge as dial-up internet. Amazon's meteoric rise hasn't just disrupted retail; it's drop-kicked it into a new dimension. While Kohl's has tried to cozy up to the giant by accepting Amazon returns in-store, it's basically like inviting a lion into your living room because you have a mouse problem.

**2. The ""Treasure Hunt"" Experience**

Kohl's stores are designed with the aesthetic of a labyrinth meets garage sale. Shoppers are expected to embark on an epic quest worthy of Indiana Jones to find that one item they didn't know they needed. In contrast, competitors like Target have streamlined, organized layouts that don't require a compass and a flare gun to navigate. Perhaps Kohl's is secretly training the next generation of explorers.

**3. Coupon Chaos Theory**

Kohl's is infamous for its mind-bending coupon strategies. With Kohl's Cash, percentage discounts, and mystery savings scratch-offs, checking out feels like filing taxes. According to Retail Dive, consumers are increasingly seeking straightforward pricing. But why make things simple when you can turn shopping into a Sudoku puzzle?

**4. Fashionably Outdated**

While other fashion retailers sprint to offer the latest trends, Kohl's appears showcasing styles that were all the rage when flip phones were cool. When was the last time you walked into Kohl's and seriously thought, ""God damn, this is fire"" Kohl's consistently presents a clothing line that can only be described as ""blah,"".

**5. Stock Market Slapstick**

Kohl's stock performance has been about as stable as a Jenga tower in an earthquake. Over the past five years, their stock price has seen significant declines. In September 2018 the stock was trading at near $80, now trading at a measly $18.  But wait, it gets juicier! The short interest in Kohl's stock has been notably high, signaling that investors are betting on the company's misfortune. It's like the stock market equivalent of people lining up to watch a train wreck in slow motion. Over 30% of Kohl's float was sold short. When a third of your investors are essentially rooting for your downfall, it's a tad suspicious. 

**Conclusion**

Unless Kohl's can reinvent itself faster than you can say ""super Saturday sale,"" it's headed for the retail graveyard, right next to Blockbuster and those weird mall pet stores. But hey, at least they'll have plenty of unsold inventory to keep them company.","Once upon a time, in the golden age of department stores, Kohl's was the go-to destination for anyone seeking a reasonably priced blender, a pair of socks, and perhaps a lawn gnome—all in one trip.

Alright, here’s where we’re at with Archer after the latest earnings and recent news, and things are getting even more interesting:

# Price Action & Momentum 🚀

Archer’s seeing strong gains today, building on the momentum from the earnings report. We’re pushing through key resistance levels, and if this keeps up, we could be looking at a breakout. With all the attention and post-earnings strength, the price action is lining up nicely for a potential run.

# Partnerships & Certification Progress 📈

The latest updates show Archer hitting key milestones with the FAA, and the partnerships with Japan Airlines, Sumitomo, and the U.S. Air Force keep adding credibility and stability. These aren’t just “what if” ideas anymore—this company is building real connections and making strides in production and certification.

# The Trump Factor and “Freedom Cities” 🌆

Now, here’s the wild card: President-elect Trump’s recent comments on building “freedom cities” and investing in flying cars. He’s talked about using federal land to create new cities that would push forward futuristic tech, like eVTOLs. If this goes forward, it could mean massive tailwinds for the eVTOL industry, with government backing and even potential infrastructure support. Archer is positioned well to benefit if Trump’s vision gets off the ground.

# Strong Fundamentals, Investor Interest & Upside Pressure 🌐

With major partnerships, clear regulatory progress, and increased investor interest, Archer is showing it’s got serious long-term potential. Even Citadel has taken a position here, adding a bit of intrigue. With so much attention from both sides of the trade, any sustained momentum could add a bit of “fuel” to the fire. For those tracking urban mobility, this one is shaping up to be interesting.

**TL;DR**: Archer’s ticking the right boxes: strong partnerships, FAA progress, growing community interest, and even Trump’s “freedom cities” vision backing the eVTOL industry. With solid fundamentals and plenty of eyes on it, Archer stands out.

Would note ELF is not pitching a trendy product, but is instead hitting at quality for the price. Their ability to expand is limited mainly by Korean brands for the same price, especially if they were to make a play towards Asia. If anything bad economic times are a boon for ELF versus the others, especially because the quality is there compared to the big names. ELF also is mostly hitting daily wear and base-case makeup, versus the long list of companies with limited release pallets for like US$150.

They're always mostly sold out in the States, and they keep adding retail partners, plus run their own store online. There's been some push back about their marketing, notably some of the bigger names to promote the brand are somehow involved in makeup influencer world which always feels super toxic somehow in a way I personally cannot understand.

They've also been doing business for over a decade, and have done some M&A to spread out into the skincare space, which by all indications people are reacting positively to. 

This company is the personal beauty equivalent of stuff like lip balms, where you end up leaving one in the office, one in the car, one at home, etc. Their brushes are priced to be used (and lost) while performing like high end stuff. 

My take is they're likely wasting money on advertising (which may be hurting them anyway) and need to just focus on keeping the quality up, negative impressions down, and expanding and outdoing the competition from Korea. Corporate has other plans, but at least they seem to guide and budget for realistic targets and then just blow them out of the water.","Not sure I'd say unlimited on ELF, but the China tariff thing feels less risky because it would have an effect on nearly every player in the makeup industry.

Alright, let’s lay it out. Celsius ($CELH) isn’t just “another” energy drink stock. It’s THE 200mg caffeine beast that came in hot and changed the entire energy drink game. We’re talking 24% YOY revenue growth, $80 million extra in the bank last quarter, and a profit margin that just keeps getting stronger. This isn’t some overhyped juice—it’s got the numbers and the growth to back it up.

Now, here’s the kicker: the stock price is sitting at $27. *Twenty-seven bucks!* This thing is basically on sale, and personally, I see this as an absolute **strong buy**. Why? Because once they hit international markets, it’s going to be a gold rush. Pepsi might have miscalculated their inventory in the short term, but this company has massive untapped potential across the globe.

Inflation fears? Some “analysts” saying people are buying fewer energy drinks? Yeah, right. Celsius isn’t slowing down—just look at the charts. And $CELH is cheaper on a P/E basis than Coca-Cola, a company that might as well be selling nostalgia at this point because its growth is stuck in reverse. Plus, the short interest is at 13%. Wall Street’s soft hands are piling in, betting against it while the institutions have pumped up their holdings by 400% this year.

TL;DR: At $27, this stock is a bargain with massive upside. Oversold? Check. Big buy signals? Check. A business with growth still in overdrive? Triple-check.

So, my honest opinion? You can sit on the sidelines, or you can load up and enjoy the ride when this thing blows up. *Your call.*","Alright, let’s lay it out.

Listen up everybody:

You’ve seen the buzz around Archer Aviation (ACHR), but this isn’t just another stock to gloss over. These guys are dead serious about bringing flying cars to reality, and I’m all in with a solid position (I’ll reveal it later). Here’s why this might be the last chance to jump on board before it really takes off:

**Momentum is building up FAST**

Even after days of strong gains, ACHR is still pushing higher today, showing no signs of slowing down. This isn’t the time to sit back, short sellers are getting sweaty, and if this momentum holds, we could be in for a serious breakout. This kind of setup doesn’t come along every day.

**Major Partnership and Real Progress**

Like I mentioned in my previous posts here, Archer isn’t just another startup in a garage. They’re partnered with **Japan Airlines, Sumitomo, and even the U.S. Air Force**, with heavyweights like **Stellantis and Boeing** backing them. FAA certification is in progress—they’re hitting real milestones, not just putting out press releases.

And in a big step for international expansion, Archer just hired a leader based in Abu Dhabi to oversee development in the UAE. This new role is part of their strategic push to bring eVTOL to the Middle East and expand their footprint globally. With someone on the ground in Abu Dhabi, they’re clearly thinking big.

**Trump's Freedom Cities and eVOLT Vision**

With Trump pushing for “**freedom cities**” and futuristic tech, including flying cars, we could see big moves toward eVTOL infrastructure. If the U.S. government starts backing this tech, Archer’s set to be at the front of the pack.

**Strong Momentum & Interest from Big Players**

With major funds like Citadel and others taking positions on ACHR, this stock has some serious eyes on it. Retail interest is ramping up too, and if this momentum keeps building, we could see some exciting moves ahead. All the ingredients are here for something big, sitting on the sidelines might mean missing out.

**TL;DR:** I’m in on ACHR with a position I’ll reveal down the line (or to mods if needed). With partnerships, certification, government backing potential, international expansion in the UAE, and pressure from short interest, this setup is primed. This could be one of those last-chance moments before it truly takes off.

2024-11-12,KO,stocks,post,1gpoc5u,,,"Waymo opens robotaxi service to anyone in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet","Waymo opens robotaxi service to anyone in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet
Alphabet-owned Waymo is removing the waitlist for its self-driving service in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet.

Starting Tuesday, anyone in LA will be able to use the Waymo One app to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County, the company said. That includes the 300,000 Angelenos who have been on Waymo’s waitlist.

With more than 3.8 million people, LA marks the third and largest city where the company’s robotaxi service is now fully available. It follows San Francisco, where Waymo One opened citywide in June. The company opened the service in Phoenix in 2020.

“Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,” Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a news release Tuesday. “Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We’re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can’t wait to serve more riders soon.”

The company has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture is owned by Google parent Alphabet, which led the series C investment in Waymo, alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

The robotaxi company now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week across its three markets via the Waymo One app, the company said Tuesday. That’s up from 100,000 in August.

Waymo in September announced that it partnered with Uber to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in 2025. The next-generation robotaxi from Waymo is a Geely Zeekr that’s equipped with custom sensors and an AI “driver.” Waymo also recently agreed to a multiyear strategic partnership with Hyundai that will add the South Korean automaker’s Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet.

The Waymo One service has been embraced by some women who have safety concerns about riding with unknown human drivers. It has also been used by parents to send their teens to school.

2024-11-12,KO,stocks,post,1gpqebe,,,"Deep dive into eBay - The Rise, The decline and The Reality Check","Deep dive into eBay - The Rise, The decline and The Reality Check
**1.0 Introduction**

eBay was originally called “AuctionWeb” when it launched in 1995. Its founder, Pierre Omidyar, created it as part of his website to experiment with online auctions. He listed his broken laser pointer for sale and sold it for **$14.83**. When he asked if the buyer understood the laser pointer was broken, the buyer responded that he was a collector and was still interested.

In 1997 the name was changed to eBay, and the rest is history.

The most expensive item ever sold on eBay is the **Gigayacht**, a 405-foot luxury yacht designed by Frank Mulder. It was purchased for **$168 million** by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.

The auctions for a lunch with Warren Buffett also took place on eBay, with the 2022 auction being won by a bid of $19 million.



**2.0 Competition**

eBay has been primarily known as the auction go-to-place, as well as the place to go for 2nd hand items. Although there is an overlap with its competitors, there is no doubt that it dominates the 2nd hand market, especially for trading cards and collectibles and it can be labeled as the market leader in Recommerce and auctions.

Its competition comes in different forms:

* **Amazon & Walmart Marketplace** \- Global eCommerce platforms focused on new products sold by businesses and third-party sellers.
* **Facebook Marketplace & Craigslist** \- Local Recommerce platforms enabling individuals to buy/sell used items within their communities.
* **Etsy** \- Global eCommerce with a focus on handmade and unique products, though it includes some Recommerce elements for vintage goods.

eBay supports eCommerce, but that is a more crowded market, where Amazon is king.

  
**3.0 Its business model**

eBay’s revenue comes in many forms:

* Final value fees
* Listing fees
* Feature fees
* Store subscription fees
* Sale of advertisements
* Revenue sharing arrangements
* Shipping fees, etc.

Ultimately, they can be grouped into 2 buckets: Transaction revenue (\~85%) and advertising (\~15%).



**3.1 The key metrics that do not add up**

In companies of this kind, two important metrics are:

* The **Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as “GMV”, represents the value of all products sold through the website.
* The **take-rate** represents their share of the GMV.

Let’s have a look at both of them.

The GMV increased from $73b in 2019 (prior to the pandemic) to $87b during the pandemic and is not back to $74b. However, if you follow their take-rate, it went up from 9% to 14% between 2019 and LTM. But this is slightly misleading. eBay changed the definition of their ""take-rate"" in 2022.

It used to be calculated as **net transaction revenue** divided by **GMV** and it changed to **net revenue** divided by **GMV**.

So, I opted for an alternative take-rate, which is definitely not a generally accepted definition. That is: **operating profit** divided by GMV. The outcome is the % of the GMV that is kept by eBay after covering all the operating expenses. There, the increase is minimal, and this adjusted take rate fluctuates around 3%.



**4.0 Historical Financial Performance**

Although its revenue is flat (\~$10 billion), eBay is a cash-generating machine, bringing **\~$2 billion** in free cash flow per year *(\~1.4 billion if SBC is subtracted)*. 

Behind the scenes, there’s something else worth noting. Not only has the revenue not been growing, but the composition has changed.



|Revenue by geography (in $m)|2021|LTM|Change (in %)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|U.S.|$5.048|$5.185|3%|
|U.K.|$1.913|$1.588|\-17%|
|China|$856|$1.124|31%|
|Germany|$1.249|$967|\-23%|
|Rest of the world|$1.354|$1.402|4%|
|Total|$10.420|$10.266|\-1%|

UK and Germany are contributing significantly less, and this decline is being compensated by growth primarily coming from China. Given that China comes with its additional risks (and competition), it can be argued that the revenue today is of lower quality than the revenue back in 2021.

This could indicate that the penetration rate in the U.S. and Western Europe is at its peak and the average long-term growth that can be expected is around the 3% historical inflation rate.



**5.0 Capital allocation**

A huge focus of the management has been returning cash to the shareholders.

Since 2019, the company returned almost $28 billion ($25b via buybacks and $3b via dividends). A lot of this came from the company’s free cash flow, but part of it came from divestitures:

* Sold 80% of eBay Korea to eMart.
* Reduced ownership in Aurelia (the privatized Adevinta entity).

  
This led to a reduction of the number of shares outstanding by 40%. This is also a very impressive number if it is presented in isolation. However, half of the repurchases were done in 2020 and 2021, when the share price was quite elevated. In hindsight, that might not have been the best decision.

One notable long-term investment of theirs is Adyen, where they own 404k shares due to the warrants based on processing volume criteria. Given Adyen’s share price, these are worth around half a billion dollars.

  
**6.0 Valuation**

This is the time to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.

The key question to answer is - **Given what is known today, how much is the company worth?**

Based on everything mentioned above, my best estimate for revenue growth is in line with inflation, as this is a mature market with a high penetration rate in the developed countries.

Similarly, I do not see any levers that the company can pull to significantly increase its profitability. For that reason, I keep its operating margin at 21%.

Based on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is $20.7b (**$43/share**), significantly below today’s share price of $62.

Here’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue growth & the operating margin:



|Revenue / Operating margin|19%|21%|23%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0% ($10.3b)|$29|$31|$33|
|34% ($13.8b)|$40|$43|$47|
|65% ($17.0b)|$47|$50|$54|



If the DCF model is reversed, for eBay to be fairly valued today, it needs to **double in size over the next decade** (average annual revenue growth of 7%) and **increase its operating margin to 23%.** Although this isn’t impossible, there’s no evidence that eBay’s growth will re-accelerate.

|China|$856|$1.124|31%|
|Germany|$1.249|$967|\-23%|
|Rest of the world|$1.354|$1.402|4%|
|Total|$10.420|$10.266|\-1%|

UK and Germany are contributing significantly less, and this decline is being compensated by growth primarily coming from China. Given that China comes with its additional risks (and competition), it can be argued that the revenue today is of lower quality than the revenue back in 2021.

This could indicate that the penetration rate in the U.S. and Western Europe is at its peak and the average long-term growth that can be expected is around the 3% historical inflation rate.



**5.0 Capital allocation**

A huge focus of the management has been returning cash to the shareholders.

Since 2019, the company returned almost $28 billion ($25b via buybacks and $3b via dividends). A lot of this came from the company’s free cash flow, but part of it came from divestitures:

* Sold 80% of eBay Korea to eMart.
* Reduced ownership in Aurelia (the privatized Adevinta entity).

  
This led to a reduction of the number of shares outstanding by 40%. This is also a very impressive number if it is presented in isolation. However, half of the repurchases were done in 2020 and 2021, when the share price was quite elevated. In hindsight, that might not have been the best decision.

One notable long-term investment of theirs is Adyen, where they own 404k shares due to the warrants based on processing volume criteria. Given Adyen’s share price, these are worth around half a billion dollars.

  
**6.0 Valuation**

This is the time to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.

The key question to answer is - **Given what is known today, how much is the company worth?**

Based on everything mentioned above, my best estimate for revenue growth is in line with inflation, as this is a mature market with a high penetration rate in the developed countries.

Similarly, I do not see any levers that the company can pull to significantly increase its profitability. For that reason, I keep its operating margin at 21%.

Based on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is $20.7b (**$43/share**), significantly below today’s share price of $62.

Here’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue growth & the operating margin:



|Revenue / Operating margin|19%|21%|23%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0% ($10.3b)|$29|$31|$33|
|34% ($13.8b)|$40|$43|$47|
|65% ($17.0b)|$47|$50|$54|



If the DCF model is reversed, for eBay to be fairly valued today, it needs to **double in size over the next decade** (average annual revenue growth of 7%) and **increase its operating margin to 23%.** Although this isn’t impossible, there’s no evidence that eBay’s growth will re-accelerate.

Kohls is pretty down if you look at their revenue and marketcap. Not a lot of room to short when its 18 a share. One thing you are forgetting is they own their stores, not lease so just in real estate they have big $. 

Every Kohls I ses is packed with women at any given time of day. Its also staffed by like 3 people. People want yo try on clothing, not get some mismatched cheap shit mailed from China thats a hassle to ship back. Kohls also does the order online stuff and they gave like a million things you can order.

Honestly their selection  beats out a lot of competitors. Target has a lot of stuff but each section is tiny with limited selection. Where as a kohls will gave like 7 different brands of one item.

As for fashion, they stick with what works. Meanwhile the gap tries to force uncool shit on you trying to stay fashionable..You go look up jeans on gaps site and its like guys wearing ugly super baggy shit dancing like buffoons and chicks wearing their boyfriends jeans from the 90s. Is that cool? Nah, that shit will be seen as cringe in a year as they try to force another trend. Meanwhile a guy can go yo Kohls and get some normal jeans and a flannel and a pair of adidas  and a pair of ray bans and have a look thats never been uncool.


Their ""anmoying deals and coupons and kohls cash"" shit people go crazy for. Thinking they are gonna get some sweet deal but the idea is it gets you into the store and you might see someyhing else you like and buy it full price or it keeps you coming back because heres $10 of Kohls Cash and dont want that to go to waste.


You say their stock has dropped from 80 to 18 and now you are going to short it. Should have done this a half decade ago. Also you are posting this bearish  DD before the holidays?

Is Kohks hard to navigate? Seems like any other store. Nens over here, shoes there, womens there, hoiseholds over there. Sounds like a you problem.

So, I was granted $5k in RSU's earlier this year when my company went public, a congratulations gift I guess. I was confused at the time, because I'd never heard of getting a dollar number amount of shares, just a set number of shares. So I figured that however many shares that ended up being, would be based on their value when they vested on January 1st 2025. (I'm in a lockup period until Feb 8th).

  
Well now, when I logged into Shareworks for the first time today to see what was going on with my RSU's since the vesting day is coming up, not only is there a set number of shares in the account, but the selling price of each share has more than HALFED the price at IPO. So my supposed $5k gift from the company, is now only \~$2200, AND DROPPING, before they've even vested.

  
I'm literally so upset, since I was planning on selling those stocks as soon as I got them (because obviously, I know absolutely nothing about the stock market and honestly, want nothing to do with it lol), and putting that towards a cross-country move with my husband. Really freaking wish they had just given me a $5k bonus outright lol

  
All that preamble though is mainly to ask, will this at least count as a capital loss if I sell after the blackout period ends so I can at least get an upside on my tax return? I know capital loss is considered when a stock is sold for less than it was purchased, so will the purchase price at least be what it was at IPO when I was given the  ""award""? Or is the purchase price going to be the price of the stocks when they vest? Please help I'm such an idiot when it comes to this shit.","Does this count as a capital loss?

Podcasts and videos can be found in the wiki here - [Podcasts and videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/medialist)

If you know nothing about the capital markets - the Getting Started section at the SEC educational site can be a good place to start - [investor.gov](https://investor.gov) \- there are also short 30 second videos on basics. The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is a US regulator with a focus to protect US investors through regulatory oversight of the securities markets.

The FINRA education site at [FINRA Education](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest) also contains numerous free courses and educational materials. FINRA is a not-for-profit SRO (self regulatory organization) which is self-funded by it's members which are broker-dealers. It works under the supervision of the SEC with a mandate to protect the investing public against fraud and bad practice.

For formal educational materials, several colleges and universities make their course work available for free. 

If want to learn about the financial markets - an older but reasonably relevant course is [Financial Markets (2011) - Yale University](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8FB14A2200B87185) This is the introduction to financial markets course taught by Prof. Shiller from Yale. Prof Shiller won the Nobel prize in economics in 2013.

Another relavant course from MIT is a lecture series on Finance Theory taught by Prof Andrew Lo - [Financial Theory (2008) - MIT](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63B2lDhyKOsImI7FjCf6eDW).

Podcasts and videos can be found in the wiki here - [Podcasts and videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/medialist)

If you know nothing about the capital markets - the Getting Started section at the SEC educational site can be a good place to start - [investor.gov](https://investor.gov) \- there are also short 30 second videos on basics. The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is a US regulator with a focus to protect US investors through regulatory oversight of the securities markets.

The FINRA education site at [FINRA Education](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest) also contains numerous free courses and educational materials. FINRA is a not-for-profit SRO (self regulatory organization) which is self-funded by it's members which are broker-dealers. It works under the supervision of the SEC with a mandate to protect the investing public against fraud and bad practice.

For formal educational materials, several colleges and universities make their course work available for free. 

If want to learn about the financial markets - an older but reasonably relevant course is [Financial Markets (2011) - Yale University](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8FB14A2200B87185) This is the introduction to financial markets course taught by Prof. Shiller from Yale. Prof Shiller won the Nobel prize in economics in 2013.

Another relavant course from MIT is a lecture series on Finance Theory taught by Prof Andrew Lo - [Financial Theory (2008) - MIT](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63B2lDhyKOsImI7FjCf6eDW).

A more current course can be found at NYU Stern School of Business by Prof Aswath Damodaran - [Corporate Finance Spring 2019](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcastcfspr19.htm). Prof Damodaran offers the latest materials and webcast lectures to this class here - https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/corpfin.html",1,,,,reddit

Fellow investors - I've built an automated tool that gives you a serious competitive advantage in your fantasy leagues. This eliminates the biggest inefficiency in fantasy sports: having to manually grab valuable free agents at 3AM EST.

* Automated player acquisition while others sleep (critical for high-value leagues) 
* Unlimited player swaps to maximize daily value 
* Advanced scheduling system to plan moves strategically

I developed this after losing out on several league-winning pickups due to timezone/work constraints. The ROI potential in competitive leagues is significant - being first to grab breakout players or injury replacements often determines who takes home the prize pool.

2024-11-13,KO,wallstreetbets,post,1gqi7zu,,,"Warren Buffett Breaks 6-Year Streak Of Berkshire Hathaway Stock Buybacks, Say 'It's Too Expensive'","Warren Buffett Breaks 6-Year Streak Of Berkshire Hathaway Stock Buybacks, Say 'It's Too Expensive'
Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett recently ended a six-year streak of stock buybacks for the company. While the company regularly participates in stock buybacks, it did not do so during the third quarter, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

Despite having over $325 billion in cash reserves, Buffett opted not to use that cash to buy back shares, suggesting that he believes the stock is too expensive.


Don't Miss:

This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before closing date.

The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.

Buffett's approach to stock buybacks is straightforward: he only buys back shares when he considers them a ""bargain."" According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filings, he looks for a stock price below the company's intrinsic value – a conservative measure considering the long-term worth of Berkshire's assets. Analysts believe the absence of buybacks sends a clear message to the market: Berkshire's stock is overvalued at its current price.

Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares are trading around 1.6 times their book value, representing the company's assets once debts are subtracted. In the past, Berkshire has avoided buybacks when the stock traded above 1.2 times its book value, but that guideline was dropped in 2018.


Trending: Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.

Buffett's conservative investment philosophy remains firm even with a more flexible policy. Robert Korajczyk, a finance professor at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, explained to CNN, ""He's been very clear that they would never buy back shares if they thought that the firm was overvalued.""

In addition to ending its buyback streak, Berkshire increased its already significant cash holdings by selling stocks in the third quarter. Some analysts took this as a cautionary move due to concerns about the current market environment.

Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.

NYU Stern School of Business professor Aswath Damodaran told CNN that Buffett's decision to hold cash suggests Berkshire is taking a conservative stance, likely due to high stock prices. ""It's a signal that they feel cautious about where the market is,"" Damodaran said. ""They've become cautious because they think the market is richly priced.""

I think immigration of skilled workers is important though, even in a competitive society. Foreign workers bring new ideas, unique skillsets, etc. The thing about skilled work is you can easily open offices overseas, as their output is generally digital. So immigration can prevent offshoring.

I think there needs to be more immigration of unskilled workers too, but IMO they need to address the housing costs first. If immigrants cannot afford to live in Korea on the wages paid, it can create a lot of problems.

Nov 14 (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is planning to kill the $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases as part of broader tax-reform legislation, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

Ending the tax credit could have grave implications for an already stalling U.S. EV transition. And yet representatives of Tesla - by far the nation's largest EV seller - have told a Trump-transition committee they support ending the subsidy, said the two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Elon Musk, one of Trump's biggest backers and the world's richest person, said earlier this year that killing the subsidy might slightly hurt Tesla sales but would devastate its U.S. EV competitors, which include legacy automakers such as General Motors.

Repealing the subsidy, which has been a signature measure of President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is being discussed in meetings by an energy-policy transition team led by billionaire oilman Harold Hamm, founder of Continental Resources, and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, the two sources said.""","""Learn more aboutRefinitiv

That's typical for a lot of countries. People are more receptive to the brightest minds entering a country that bring value to the economy, than people coming that rely on assistance. I don't see how its an issue. Importing foreign talent is important to ensuring Korean Businesses stay competitive globally.

> I highly suggest you look into the Seoul housing situation. The numbers aren’t adding up unless the entire country plans to move here

I think housing is overpriced a lot globally. Here in Chicago we're losing population the past decade, doesn't stop housing from going up. I think what you'll see is the most desirable places to live go up in value, but less desirable spots such as rural areas go down in value. Korea's real estate market might end up looking like Japan's.

I'm not investing in housing, though, I'm investing in businesses. 

My understanding is the Korean financial system for housing is much more risk averse than in the US. In the US, we give people loans to buy a home with 0% down, sometimes with little income, which caused our 2008 housing crisis. From what I read in Korea, most people do not get loans for houses, and you need to put down 50% of the property value just to rent?

So unless I am missing something, how would a housing crash impact Korean businesses or banks, since mortgages are not common?

>Money might be made from exports, but imports are killing the economy here. Produce is through the roof. 

The KRW depreciated against USD from 1100krw/usd in 2021 to 1400 krw/usd  in 2024. A depreciating currency helps exports which is where the profits are. But obviously, it is harsh for residents that face a devalued currency. Hopefully the KRW will regain its value as the US cuts interest rates.

2024-11-14,KO,wallstreetbets,post,1grc49j,,,"South Korea's ""Value Up"" program, and why Korean stocks will boom over the next decade.","South Korea's ""Value Up"" program, and why Korean stocks will boom over the next decade.
Korean stocks have long been undervalued, referred to as the ""Korean discount"". This is in part due to concerns over North Korea, low dividend payouts/buybacks relative to earnings, difficulty for retail investors to access Korean markets(other than ETFs),governance concerns of ""Chaebol""(family controlled companies), foreign exchange rate risk, and most recently, tariffs.

The Korean market has grown increasingly cheaper recently, down 42% from its peak 3 years ago. Right now Korea's stock market is trading below book value(0.96x), compared to the US, which is trading at 4.8x book value.

Earlier this year, South Korea unveiled a voluntary program called ""Value Up"", aimed to address this undervaluation. In addition to a lot of voluntary improvements in disclosures modeled after programs that pushes Japan's market to new highs, the program offers tax credits equal to 5% of the increases in buybacks/dividends. The government is literally paying companies to buy back their stock. Meanwhile in the US we tax stock buybacks. 

In addition to these tax incentives to juice stock prices, South Korea has also cut corporate tax rates, cancelled a capital gains tax, and cut inheritance taxes.

There are some insanely cheap stocks in Korea, some examples:

- SK Hynix, for example, is trading at 8.45x forward earnings. And they're growing very fast due to AI and the need for high speed memory for GPUs/AI chips. 

- Samsung, the largest company in Korea, is trading at 9x forward earnings. This is despite substantial growth over the past decade. While they do face struggles in their foundry business with their 3 nm process, they are a very diversified business, and still very profitable despite their challenges. If their next process fares better, there is tremendous upside. In comparison, TSMC trades at 23.38x forward earnings, Intel 28.01x.

- Hyundai trades at 2.75x forward earnings, Kia 3.62X. Car companies usually trade at low PE during boom periods due to being cyclical and capital intensive, but to compare, GM has a forward P/E of 5.13, Ford 6.33, Tesla 99.14. So even after adjusting for industry, Korean auto companies are very cheap.

When you combine cheap stocks with governments subsidizing dividends/buybacks, high returns seem very probable over the long term.

With the US market's P/E ratio hitting record highs despite rising bond yields, the Korean market seems like a really strong opportunity for investors concerned with valuations and looking to diversify

Positions: I'm buying a lot of the etf EWY because I can't buy individual securities. I looked at FLKR because it supposedly had a lower Expense ratio, but it has somehow consistently underperformed EWY and has less liquidity, so I went with EWY.","Korean stocks have long been undervalued, referred to as the ""Korean discount"".

I've been tracking Palantir's commercial clients since they began offering their software publicly and noticed several companies credit it for significant cost savings in their earnings calls. Factoring in Palantir’s impact could be useful when deciding which companies to invest in.  These are the ones I've collected; if you have any others, please let me know so I can add them to my list[.](https://imgur.com/a/F1dK7I7)

Written by ChatGPT because to regarded to articulate n too lazy to write myself

Cauldron Energy (CXU) presents a unique opportunity in the uranium sector, currently undervalued despite holding substantial uranium resources and displaying significant exploration success. This presentation explores how CXU could follow a trajectory similar to that of Boss Energy (BOE), which experienced substantial stock price growth between 2020 and its peak in 2024. Several factors, including rising uranium prices, political changes in Western Australia, and increasing global demand for nuclear energy, position CXU for a potential breakout.

1. Undervaluation Relative to Market Peers
CXU remains undervalued relative to its peers, particularly when compared to BOE during its early development phase. Despite having substantial uranium assets at the Yanrey Uranium Project, CXU’s market capitalization remains low. This is largely due to market underappreciation of its progress and untapped potential, much like BOE before it advanced the Honeymoon Project towards production. As market conditions shift and more investors recognize CXU’s resource base and exploration success, its stock price could mirror the significant gains seen in BOE, whose stock rose from under $0.10 in 2020 to over $5.50 by February 2024.

2. Rising Uranium Spot Price
One of the primary drivers behind BOE's significant share price growth was the sharp rise in uranium prices, which have been on an upward trajectory due to a combination of supply shortages and increased demand from the nuclear energy sector. Between 2020 and 2024, the uranium spot price surged from around $30/lb to over $70/lb, driven by global energy security concerns and the transition to low-carbon energy sources.
Cauldron Energy, with its substantial uranium resources in Western Australia, stands to benefit in a similar manner. As uranium prices continue to rise, the market will place a higher value on CXU’s projects. The Yanrey Project is particularly well-positioned, with recent drill results confirming the presence of high-grade uranium mineralization, similar to the findings that initially sparked BOE’s rise

3. Favorable Political Developments
A critical factor in CXU’s future growth potential is the outcome of the 2025 Western Australian state election. If the Liberal Party wins, it is expected to create a more favorable regulatory environment for uranium mining. Historically, Liberal governments in Western Australia have been more supportive of resource extraction industries, including uranium. Under a Liberal government, regulatory barriers may be reduced, allowing companies like Cauldron Energy to expedite exploration and production activities.
BOE’s stock benefited greatly from a favorable regulatory environment, and a similar shift could serve as a catalyst for CXU’s share price. This could result in the acceleration of key projects like Yanrey, increasing investor confidence and unlocking shareholder value.
4. Promising Exploration Results
Cauldron’s 2024 exploration campaign has yielded positive results from the Manyingee South Prospect at the Yanrey Project. Recent drill holes, such as 24YRAC103 and 24YRAC104, have intersected high-grade uranium mineralization, including grades of 1,021 ppm eU₃O₈ over 4.34 meters and 2,918 ppm eU₃O₈ over 1.84 meters

These promising results confirm the significant uranium potential at Yanrey, with mineralization zones comparable to Paladin Energy’s nearby Manyingee deposit.

Much like BOE’s early-stage exploration successes, these results could lay the groundwork for future resource upgrades and production feasibility studies, both of which could serve as key inflection points for CXU’s stock price. The proven uranium reserves enhance the economic viability of the project, making it more attractive to institutional investors.

5. Strong Demand for Nuclear Energy
Global energy markets are increasingly shifting toward nuclear power as a reliable, low-carbon energy source. As countries focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring energy security, nuclear power has become a key part of the energy transition. China, India, and Japan, among others, are ramping up nuclear energy capacity, leading to rising demand for uranium.
This growing demand is expected to push uranium prices even higher, which in turn increases the value of uranium mining companies. As the global need for uranium outstrips current supply, companies with established resources, like CXU, are well-positioned to capitalize on this shortage. The nuclear renaissance that has driven BOE’s growth over the past few years is likely to continue, further boosting the potential for uranium-focused stocks like CXU


6. Shareholder and Investor Base
Cauldron Energy currently has a diverse shareholder base, with institutional and strategic investors holding stakes in the company. However, there is significant room for growth as more institutional investors become aware of CXU’s exploration success and the favorable uranium market conditions. As was the case with BOE, an increase in institutional ownership and strategic partnerships could act as a major driver of share price growth. CXU’s undervaluation, combined with its exploration success and market potential, could attract more investors in the near future.

Conclusion
Cauldron Energy (CXU) is positioned to follow a trajectory similar to Boss Energy (BOE), which saw its stock price increase dramatically between 2020 and 2024. Several factors, including rising uranium prices, strong exploration results, a favorable political environment following the 2025 Western Australian election, and increasing global demand for nuclear energy, make CXU a highly promising investment. As these factors converge, there is significant potential for CXU’s stock to appreciate, potentially mirroring the success that BOE experienced.
Given the combination of exploration success and favorable market conditions, Cauldron Energy appears significantly undervalued at present, offering a compelling investment opportunity as the uranium sector continues to expand.

 Furthermore, I did some digging and found the major share holder (Parle Investments Pty Ltd) is the same guy for farms and supplies McDonald’s Australia with their succulent pickles. Does the pickle man know something we don’t??

CXU 2024 Annual report:

Cauldron Energy (CXU) presents a unique opportunity in the uranium sector, currently undervalued despite holding substantial uranium resources and displaying significant exploration success. This presentation explores how CXU could follow a trajectory similar to that of Boss Energy (BOE), which experienced substantial stock price growth between 2020 and its peak in 2024. Several factors, including rising uranium prices, political changes in Western Australia, and increasing global demand for nuclear energy, position CXU for a potential breakout.

1. Undervaluation Relative to Market Peers
CXU remains undervalued relative to its peers, particularly when compared to BOE during its early development phase. Despite having substantial uranium assets at the Yanrey Uranium Project, CXU’s market capitalization remains low. This is largely due to market underappreciation of its progress and untapped potential, much like BOE before it advanced the Honeymoon Project towards production. As market conditions shift and more investors recognize CXU’s resource base and exploration success, its stock price could mirror the significant gains seen in BOE, whose stock rose from under $0.10 in 2020 to over $5.50 by February 2024.

Abstract:

ABO Wind has confirmed 2023 guidance (net profit of EUR22m to EUR26m). For

2024, the company expects a net profit of EUR25m to EUR31m. Taking the

respective guidance midpoints as a reference (EUR24m and EUR28m), this would

result in net profit growth of 17% y/y. Management also expects net profit

to rise in subsequent years. Although the wind industry is currently

struggling with project delays, higher interest rates and delivery

difficulties, ABO Wind also expects good results in 2024. The reason for

this is a high quality internationally diversified project pipeline that

has grown steadily in recent years. More and more projects are reaching

construction maturity, giving ABO Wind the opportunity to either sell the

project rights immediately or build the projects itself. We see our growth

forecasts as confirmed and are sticking to our EUR106 price target. After the

share price decline in recent months, ABO Wind is attractively valued at a

2024 P/E ratio of 15. We reiterate our Buy recommendation.

The raw materials to make said battery are from parts where they can't compete on tariffs Congo, Indonesia, Argentina, Chile, and South Africa. 

Tesla is back ordered. Still, there products are always going to be a hot ticket. With the lack of EV competitors more and more people are going to give money away for a pre order of a Tesla.

I read all the comments in here along with a bunch of articles on seeking alpha.

Of the 4, Japan was the only one I was interested in, but I was unsure about Trumps tariff policy so I decided to not go through with it.

Currently, I’m debating between buying SCHD (which seems fairly valued) or some of the individual tickers you mentioned. It seems that holding cash is unanimously considered a poor idea outside of emergency funds or storing money for a large purchase like a house. I’m prepared to rotate more of the SP500 to decrease my risk profile too. I work at a huge tech company and get its stocks as part of my salary, so I’m certainly not short on exposure to tech regardless of me rotating an additional 10-20%","Thanks for the write up!

Hey Reddit,

  
I am doing a personal research to understand the retail investing landscape. The post-COVID surge in retail investing appears to be more than a temporary trend, with continued growth suggesting a fundamental shift in wealth-building mindsets. More individuals now recognize investing, rather than traditional employment alone, as a crucial path to financial growth.

This cohort of investors are becoming a powerful force to be reckoned with. Public companies are highly susceptible to the power of the retail investors, [47% of whom want to be “more involved”](https://www.bnymellon.com/content/dam/bnymellon/documents/pdf/insights/the-state-of-the-us-retail-investor.pdf) in the companies they invest in and 58% voting their proxies to make their voices heard. In aggregate, these retail investors can move markets, exemplified by the [$15.6B in outflows](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/retail-investors-sell-off-us-stocks-at-fastest-pace-in-years-during-october-78276259) they drove in October of 2023 alone.

  
I am interested to dig deeper into the individual stock picker cohort a bit more. Myself being an active investor I have a couple of stocks that I own and manage. I do fundamental analysis as well as actively keep up-to date with the latest news, attend investor calls and what not. But I do feel that the communication feels a bit one way sometimes and would be great if there was a way to actively engage with the companies I invest it. 

  
Trying to gauge if this is just a me thing or something much more of a broader phenomena.

*  Do you feel like a true shareholder in the companies you invest in? Do you even care to be one. Why/why not?
* How do you currently engage with companies you've invested in? (e.g., earnings calls, IR websites, social media)
* What's missing in your current relationship with these companies?
* Would you value more direct engagement opportunities? If so, what kind?
* Has lack of engagement ever influenced your investment decisions?
* Would you be interested in connecting with other retail investors who hold the same stocks? What would you want from such connections?","Hey Reddit,

So even despite the much lower cost of housing and living compared to tech hubs it’ll be quickly erased by the salary differences due to just how uncompetitive pay in tech is there compared to areas of the world that are aggressively hiring and with the funding to do so. It almost reminds me of how Germany spent years and years trying to grow its own version of Silicon Valley with various start-ups but it just never took off partly because like a lot of countries the general risk-taking nature of tech and the kinds of personalities that it tends to imply were not able to be drawn and retained there.

After all, software companies are trying to hire outside the US more now to avoid paying those exorbitant salaries in an effort to keep appeasing investors more interested in value than growth.","The median income in Korea is shockingly low compared to most developed countries and I almost compare it more to Spain than countries like the Netherlands or the US when it comes to pay for educated, skilled workers.

2024-11-15,KO,wallstreetbets,post,1gru6hv,,,"Unemployment, UberEats, Domino’s, and Square","Unemployment, UberEats, Domino’s, and Square
Hear me out. You get fired from your job because your company can’t justify their stock price with you on board. That’s cool and fine, you’re filing for unemployment now. 

Your schedule is a little out of whack so you don’t really know what to do but stay home more of the day and search for jobs, but you send out some applications and nobody answers. Damn there’s always tomorrow though. 

Tomorrow comes and you realize you woke up at 11 am, you scroll your phone and then finally try to start applying for jobs again. GF comes home says she’s hungry, shit it’s 6’o-clock and you didn’t make jack shit and you got no groceries. 

You’re not going to go to Costco to save money and buy bulk for only yourself, and honestly you look and feel like garbage cuz u didn’t leave the house all day. You don’t want to go out, your gf doesn’t wanna go out, “Let me order something for us babe.”

You open UberEats and you see a coupon for 50% off for your next three orders and you think to yourself holy shit that sounds good as fuck! You see what restaurants are on there and it’s mostly garbage at the top of the scroll, overpriced fast food $15 per McCombo garbo and then you see a ‘free pizza with a $10purchase’ deal on Domino’s.

You think to yourself “Man that’s such a good deal” and you go onto the app and grab yourself your 2 topping pizza and then add a $10 entree and try to check out, but then the coupon for 50% off can be used if your subtotal is $20 or more. “But my subtotal is already $20 literally says it right there,” No Dipshit, that’s your free pizza, so you go and add another entree probably some pasta or salad cuz ur girlfriend would like those.

You go to the checkout and hey it’s actually pretty damn cheap!! $23 including all the fees before tip! You’re not really bothered by the fact that the service fee is actually taking a percentage of your total cart size including that free pizza, cuz it’s still a good ass deal for you.

Food comes and it’s great, day or two passes and you realize you have two more coupons you gotta use up by the end of this week. This time you want to get something different since you’ve also just been eating some shitty packaged garbage while you’ve been staying at home, so you surf through some deals again and “wow! I didn’t even know they have shake shack on here!” 

You order your shake shack cuz that shit good af and then UberEats sends the order over to Shake Shack. Except it’s not Shake Shack’s system receiving it, it’s Square’s Point of Sale System. Square then pushes it over to the employee to make and collects a nice little fee off of it, $1 per each order placed. 

Yes there’s going to be people who really want to go and get groceries and cook but let’s be real no one wants to cook when they’re depressed as shit man. You could go to McDonalds and tell your body to fuck off by consuming a $5 meal deal, or maybe just get a $14 combo instead. But at that point, staying at home and ordering kinda just feels a lot better, it’s not that much more expensive when you get a deal. 

TLDR: Long DPZ, UBER, SQ for the counterintuitive bullishness of food delivery success in a bad economy with rising unemployment. More people lose job, more people depressed, more people stay home.

Sleep schedule becomes whack, and food is so easy to order now you don’t even have to get out of bed. McD might suffer if you order a cheaper thing, and so might every other store, but SQ charges a flat fee to fulfill online orders so it doesn’t matter. 

Uber deals and Dominos deals are best in the biz by far, and people love deals so much even if you tack on a bunch of fees it’s the deal that matters.","Hear me out. You get fired from your job because your company can’t justify their stock price with you on board. That’s cool and fine, you’re filing for unemployment now. 

Your schedule is a little out of whack so you don’t really know what to do but stay home more of the day and search for jobs, but you send out some applications and nobody answers. Damn there’s always tomorrow though. 

Tomorrow comes and you realize you woke up at 11 am, you scroll your phone and then finally try to start applying for jobs again. GF comes home says she’s hungry, shit it’s 6’o-clock and you didn’t make jack shit and you got no groceries. 

You’re not going to go to Costco to save money and buy bulk for only yourself, and honestly you look and feel like garbage cuz u didn’t leave the house all day. You don’t want to go out, your gf doesn’t wanna go out, “Let me order something for us babe.”

You open UberEats and you see a coupon for 50% off for your next three orders and you think to yourself holy shit that sounds good as fuck! You see what restaurants are on there and it’s mostly garbage at the top of the scroll, overpriced fast food $15 per McCombo garbo and then you see a ‘free pizza with a $10purchase’ deal on Domino’s.

You think to yourself “Man that’s such a good deal” and you go onto the app and grab yourself your 2 topping pizza and then add a $10 entree and try to check out, but then the coupon for 50% off can be used if your subtotal is $20 or more. “But my subtotal is already $20 literally says it right there,” No Dipshit, that’s your free pizza, so you go and add another entree probably some pasta or salad cuz ur girlfriend would like those.

You go to the checkout and hey it’s actually pretty damn cheap!! $23 including all the fees before tip! You’re not really bothered by the fact that the service fee is actually taking a percentage of your total cart size including that free pizza, cuz it’s still a good ass deal for you.

Food comes and it’s great, day or two passes and you realize you have two more coupons you gotta use up by the end of this week. This time you want to get something different since you’ve also just been eating some shitty packaged garbage while you’ve been staying at home, so you surf through some deals again and “wow! I didn’t even know they have shake shack on here!” 

You order your shake shack cuz that shit good af and then UberEats sends the order over to Shake Shack. Except it’s not Shake Shack’s system receiving it, it’s Square’s Point of Sale System. Square then pushes it over to the employee to make and collects a nice little fee off of it, $1 per each order placed. 

Yes there’s going to be people who really want to go and get groceries and cook but let’s be real no one wants to cook when they’re depressed as shit man. You could go to McDonalds and tell your body to fuck off by consuming a $5 meal deal, or maybe just get a $14 combo instead. But at that point, staying at home and ordering kinda just feels a lot better, it’s not that much more expensive when you get a deal.

2024-11-15,KO,wallstreetbets,post,1grqiw1,,,Those who think removing the EV tax credit will help Tesla are smoking some exotic copium. Here's my crystal ball.,"Those who think removing the EV tax credit will help Tesla are smoking some exotic copium. Here's my crystal ball.
1. Trump removes $7,500 EV tax credits and imposes import tariffs on all imported EVs.
2. The US EV manufacturers are starved out, and Tesla is the only surviving US EV maker - I quote ""Tesla does not depend on subsidies"".
3. Tesla increases its US EV market share, seemingly as the only car manufacturer without risk of discontinuity.
4. Nonetheless, Tesla delivery numbers remain stagnant despite increased US market share due to lowering overall EV sales.
5. Tesla now monopolises the US EV market, significantly diluting the need to compete.
6. US import tariffs are now in full effect. Imported parts are too expensive, and cost-cutting is prioritised. Tesla's costly R&D takes a backseat.
7. China, Korea and the Germans retaliate by imposing tariffs on Tesla imports, crippling Tesla's global market EV share.
8. Chinese, Korean and German EV makers continue to improve EV capabilities in a 3-cornered fight, widening the tech gap to Tesla.
9. The difference in EVs has now become more apparent. Tesla now lacks value for money and is no longer relevant to the global market. The US is dethroned as a major EV leader.
10. Tesla now struggles to sustain revenue growth without the global market. It now struggles to justify its colossal trillion-dollar valuation. Tesla needs to milk the already-drying US harder, somehow.
11. A new generation of Tesla bagholders is created.","1. Trump removes $7,500 EV tax credits and imposes import tariffs on all imported EVs.

2024-11-16,KO,wallstreetbets,comment,1grc49j,lxief1h,t1_lxi3tyt,,"Past Performance chasing is a well documented phenomenon with historically bad results. It is very common for investors to seek out investments that have performed well in recent history, regardless of valuation.

I think what we're seeing in Korea is just a case of performance chasing. Koreans see the US stock market price went up 4x over the past 10 years, while KOSPI is up just 17%(or negative if you go by USD price).

Investors are extrapolating past performance regardless of fundamentals. And by this logic, why wouldn't you invest in the US market?

We are seeing this in just about every foreign country, not just Korea. Practically every European or Canadian I talk to about investing is either just buying the S&P500/NASDAQ, or US tech stocks. I do not know any that buy their own country's market.

The same logic is exactly why Koreans are also pouring tons of money into digital currencies. They see these currencies have outperformed the stock market, so they pour money into it.

The overwhelming majority of US outperformance can be explained by corporate tax cuts, interest rate declines, foreign exchange rates, and rising valuations(relative to earnings). But the average retail investor is not aware of this. They just see 2 price charts, and the choice is seemingly obvious.

With that said, are there risks to investing in Korea? Absolutely. This is true of literally any emerging market. But these risks are not as significant as other emerging markets such as Russia, China, Taiwan, or India.

I do not understand how investors pour money into China, when the CCP has shown it does not care about foreign investors and can kill industries on a whim, and tons of corruption. But when there's an occasional scandal in Korea, people say the whole market is non-investable at any price.","Past Performance chasing is a well documented phenomenon with historically bad results.

Outside of a couple brutal drawdowns, this was by far my best year trading and best year overall financially for me along with my other gig.

Strategy is trading the opening range breakout, in tandem with VWAP, 8/21 EMA's, PDL/PDL, in tandem with algo. This has been mostly options on SPY and QQQ. NO ODTE'S

I struggled for years and got my a\*\* handed to me. Initially took 43k and ran it to 347k in a little over 3 months time in 2021. I felt invincible. Man, I couldn't have been more wrong. Proceeded to lose all of it. Slipped into a deep crippling depression.I had zero concept of risk management. Spent the next year slowly building back with tight stops and NO trading unless my setup presented itself.

I see options on the chain slightly OTM at $65 $66, and $67 strikes dated for expiration between the end of this month and middle of December with relatively low bid/ask spreads. I've been looking at entering a position on Monday depending on how the day open goes planning to take advantage of this. Honestly, I see $KO making a huge rebound with a one month time period back to $65.

**My plan, buy x50 contracts of:**

- $64 11/29 (current: 0.12), 

- $65 12/6 (current: 0.09), 

- $66 12/13 (current: 0.07)

**and sell x50 contracts of:**

-$67.5 12/20 (to reduce cost basis, current: 0.07)

Besides the stock just not going up at least 4.99% before last expiration, I don't see any issue with this trade given the RSI(14) indicating it is oversold, it is nearly touching the bottom MA(50), and below it's shorter span moving averages. It surely must go back up, right?

There’s a lot of competitors in this market but Garmin has produced, for the most part, quality for years. 

They’re a very recognizable brand for people involved in aviation, fitness, and even marine (boats) industries and auto sectors. I’ve seen more and more Garmin devices among friends that are into fitness over the last couple of years due to their durable designs and longer lasting batteries as well as data provided by their workout tracking systems. The data they provide over competitors is typically more technical and appeals to a different crowd. I’ve tried various wearables myself and Garmin was the best all rounder for fitness tracking in my opinion.

As always, there was an element of luck involved too!","GRMN is primarily a GPS tech company, they’ve been around for years and have recently shot up due to increases in the consumer wearable market, mainly in fitness.

There’s a lot of competitors in this market but Garmin has produced, for the most part, quality for years. 

They’re a very recognizable brand for people involved in aviation, fitness, and even marine (boats) industries and auto sectors. I’ve seen more and more Garmin devices among friends that are into fitness over the last couple of years due to their durable designs and longer lasting batteries as well as data provided by their workout tracking systems. The data they provide over competitors is typically more technical and appeals to a different crowd. I’ve tried various wearables myself and Garmin was the best all rounder for fitness tracking in my opinion.

Majority of private flyers will request something which is freshly (as is humanly possible) prepared.

But then you get people wanting to show off who want things from specific high end restaurants. Or sometimes, I guess for a gimmick, places like McDonald’s or Starbucks.

Essentially what happens is the food is ordered and collected, blast chilled, re packaged in like microwave / oven friendly boxes then delivered about an hour before take off. 

Then during the food service, the flight attendant will heat it all up and present it however necessary.

I remember having an argument over the phone with a Jewish restaurant, as client wanted something from there but the restaurant insisted this process would make it non kosher.

2024-11-17,KO,wallstreetbets,comment,1gs6ij1,lxiz1f9,t3_1gs6ij1,,"Throwback to the time when Israel convinced America to invade Iraq. US-Iran war incoming? Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Palantir seem like the best way to play it. 

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/aug/17/iraq.israel1

> Pressure from Israel and the Lobby was not the only factor behind the decision to attack Iraq in March 2003, but it was critical. Some Americans believe that this was a war for oil, but there is hardly any direct evidence to support this claim. Instead, the war was motivated in good part by a desire to make Israel more secure. According to Philip Zelikow, a former member of the president’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, the executive director of the 9/11 Commission, and now a counsellor to Condoleezza Rice, the “real threat” from Iraq was not a threat to the United States.

> The “unstated threat” was the “threat against Israel”, Zelikow told an audience at the University of Virginia in September 2002. “The American government,” he added, “doesn’t want to lean too hard on it rhetorically, because it is not a popular sell.”

> At the same time, Ehud Barak wrote a New York Times op-ed warning that “the greatest risk now lies in inaction”. His predecessor as prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, published a similar piece in the Wall Street Journal, entitled: “The Case for Toppling Saddam”. “Today nothing less than dismantling his regime will do,” he declared. “I believe I speak for the overwhelming majority of Israelis in supporting a pre-emptive strike against Saddam’s regime.” Or as Ha’aretz reported in February 2003, “the military and political leadership yearns for war in Iraq”.

> Pressure from Israel and the Lobby was not the only factor behind the decision to attack Iraq in March 2003, but it was critical. Some Americans believe that this was a war for oil, but there is hardly any direct evidence to support this claim. Instead, the war was motivated in good part by a desire to make Israel more secure.

Reality check: deporting millions of illegal immigrants will kill the construction industry, sending housing prices higher; it will destroy agriculture as those who harvest will be gone, sending food prices soaring; it will severely crimp the restaurant business… etc. And tariffs are taxes placed on good sold here — raising the price of those goods. No, we cannot instantly start domestically producing all the things we import from China, Mexico, etc. Prices will go up. The easily-duped Trumpers who blamed Biden for pandemic-related inflation and thought Trump was “good for the economy” are going to get a rude awakening. 

Fox “news” and Russian propaganda will tell the willfully ignorant it’s not Trump’s fault but reality will show itself at the checkout line.

Yes many mentors, but you eventually out grow them.

Yea, eating clean and working out helps with every facet of life. I found the motivation by finding the bottom. Only when my body was “bankrupt” did I find the resolve to work my ass off to get clean. Now it’s with me forever. While I lapse and don’t always eat clean and occasionally miss workouts, it’s a lifestyle now, so even if I have a couple of off months I find my way back to eating clean and working out. Now that I know what it feels like to be clean and workout endlessly it keeps me motivated to keep at it. It feels amazing, despite the effort.

Spend only 70% of what you make. Invest 30%. Do whatever it takes to cut expenses to do this. Eating out doesn’t matter. Your nice apt doesn’t matter. Your car does’t matter. You have to stop caring what people think about you so you can invest 30% of whatever you make. 2. As you make more, don’t increase your expenses. Invest all of the increase in pay. Until you are investing 70% of what you make and living on 30% of your paycheck. 3. Lose money. Take bets, take chances. Lose money for years. Never spend what you make in investing, always reinvest it. Over time failure will teach you. At first aim for 3 trades out of 7 making money. Eventually, the more money you lose, the better you will become at trading. This number will eventually become 8 out of every 10 trades you win. You will never win them all though. So get comfortable with losing money. I lost millions in “pay check” money before I started printing. Took me 5 years to really “learn”. Took me another 5 to start doing really well.","Thanks for the great questions.

I've stumbled upon Tsodilo Resources, and it might just be the hidden gem we're all looking for! Here's why this could be the next big play:

# Why Tsodilo Resources?

1. **Gcwihaba Xaudum Iron Project (XIF)**: This project could become Botswana’s first iron ore mine! The scoping studies show promising results with multiple positive NPV scenarios. Imagine getting in early on a project with a potential lifespan of over 50 years!
2. **Recent Legal Victory**: Tsodilo Resources just won a crucial court case reinstating their prospecting licenses in the Okavango Delta buffer zone. This legal win clears the path for continued exploration and development, bolstering investor confidence.
3. **Stage 1 Potential**: A low-risk start-up with a 60-70% operating margin and an IRR of 80%. That's some serious upside potential, with an expected NPV of $850 million.
4. **Strategic Location**: Positioned to supply the booming southern African and international markets. The project includes plans for shipping to Europe, India, and China.
5. **Diverse Opportunities**: Beyond iron, they've identified prospects for copper, cobalt, gold, and rare earth elements. Talk about diversification!
6. **Railway:** There is also a new Trans-kalahari railway being built which will provide port access and international markets.

# Context: Botswana's Diamond Industry

* **New Leadership**: Botswana’s new president, Duma Boko, aims to quickly finalize a new sales pact with De Beers. This could stabilize and enhance the country's diamond sector, potentially impacting related industries.
* **De Beers Negotiations**: Boko is keen to mend relations with De Beers, emphasizing compromise for a sustainable agreement. This could have positive economic implications for Botswana.
* **Market Dynamics**: Although diamond prices have slumped, the resolution of political and business uncertainties could invigorate market prospects.

# Risks to Consider

* **Development Stage**: Still in exploration phases, so there's inherent risk. But with high risk comes high reward.
* **Capital Requirements**: Significant CAPEX involved, especially for full-scale operations.

# What's Next?

* **Strategic Partnership**: Partnered with Mineral Development Company Botswana to drive the project forward. This collaboration could ensure the project is developed efficiently and economically.
* **Upcoming Developments**: A Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) is underway, aiming to solidify the economic viability and strategy for moving forward.

# Conclusion

This isn't financial advice, but Tsodilo Resources could be a game-changer. With huge potential returns, a strategic plan, and a recent legal victory, it might just be the perfect time to dive in. Plus, with new leadership in Botswana focusing on economic stability, the timing could be ideal.

Would love to know what fellow aper's think? Anyone know much about Botswana?

Excellent post from u/Koiguy94 about how MSTR is funded by debt and issuing shares to leverage up. 

I just wanted to add onto his findings.
In this scenario where one asset is funded by debt and the other is equity. You’d long the equity and short the debt. This way you’d gain on the performance of the asset increasing over the debt that is weighing it down.

In a long short scenario you would become market neutral and the trade becomes pure trend following where longing the top performer and shorting the laggard works well.

I did hone in on aspects of use needed for warfare but I also think that a lot of what I said also covers their non-military transport and logistics, which are huge sinks of oil for energy use. I would imagine they also have issues like we have in the US where the more rural, food and material producing areas would really suffer if their imports are messed up. Especially too since From what I've read, China has pretty poor domestic production of oil compared to what they need and its estimated that they continue increasing their oil imports at least through the early 2030s. My original point was that the parent comment's supposition isn't going to happen because there is no way they're going to be all electric in 20 years. They definitely are moving in a better direction but not enough to be insulated from worrying about petroleum supply lines, especially with so many geopolitical rivals that would be breathing down their neck in a hypothetical global war like India, South Korea, and the Philippines there to really tighten down the screws on any imports.","Agreed on your points.

The Trump transition team is prioritizing the development of a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles, aiming to revise current regulations that limit the deployment of autonomous cars without human controls. This move aligns with the interests of Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO and a prominent Trump supporter, who is heavily invested in autonomous technology, including plans to launch driverless Tesla robotaxis by 2026.

Current regulations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) allow only 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under exemptions, creating barriers for Tesla and other manufacturers aiming for large-scale deployment. The Trump team is exploring leadership options for the Transportation Department, including former Uber executive Emil Michael, to craft policies that could facilitate mass adoption. Bipartisan legislative efforts to increase deployment caps and establish federal rules for autonomous vehicles have faced repeated setbacks, including challenges in Congress and failed compromises during the Biden administration.

Musk, who has been appointed alongside entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead Trump’s ""Department of Government Efficiency,"" is advocating for streamlined regulations and has pledged to push for policies enabling nationwide use of autonomous vehicles. The initiative has raised concerns among rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft, whose stock prices dipped following Musk’s announcements.

The push reflects broader ambitions to dismantle regulatory hurdles and advance emerging technologies under the Trump administration, though significant legislative and bureaucratic challenges remain.

FBNDX is a proxy for BND since they have almost the same volatilities, but FBNDX has longer history and also performa better than BND, so this overstates what a BND inclusion would provide.

As you can clearly see, the increasing inclusion of ZROZ (a 25+ treasury bond fund) produces much smaller max drawdowns for the overall portfolio when you rebalance annually.

This is taking some bet to juice returns. It follows markowitz portfolio theory to add anti-correlated assets with real expected returns to calcel out the volatilities of the other components. Risk of individual portfolio components isnt what matters: its the overall portfolio's risk thats important.

A bond index fund like BND is a shitty diversifier (yes, this is the primary weakness of the bogleheads). Its full of corporate bonds (poorer diversifiers) and mostly short duration bonds (poorsr diversifiers).","*Risk adjusted*

(A MARA Remix)

🎵 Just a small-town trader, holding through the crypto night,

Trading tickers daily, dreaming of all-time highs.

The market dips, the market soars,
Who knows what the chart implores?
Hodl tight, don’t sell in fright,
Tomorrow could bring delight.

Chorus:
Don’t stop believing,
Hold onto MARA’s climb!
Crypto dreams are gleaming,
Bull runs just take time.

🎵 Options burning bright, as earnings draw near,
Bulls and bears collide, who’ll lead the charge this year?
FOMO spreads like fire, whispers of a breakout higher,
Traders gamble on the move, fueled by crypto desire.

Charts don’t lie, RSI’s tight,
Will MARA break out tonight?
On the edge, nerves collide,
Diamond hands or a bumpy ride?

Chorus:
Don’t stop believing,
Trust the blockchain grind!

This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on technical analysis (TA), but if TA is not your thing then just ignore the theme.

  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

2024-11-19,KO,wallstreetbets,post,1gusfdx,,,Wallstreet forecasts 'normal' year for stocks in 2025 - Some guy on the Internet disagrees.,"Wallstreet forecasts 'normal' year for stocks in 2025 - Some guy on the Internet disagrees.
According to yahoo finance [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-forecasts-normal-year-for-stocks-in-2025-after-historic-rally-182124444.html) and [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-forecasts-p-500-054053974.html) several big financial institutions see the S&P moderating to a ""normal"" growth rate with the hype over AI starting to wane and a likely transition into other sectors. These are very reasonable assessments, if you make your prognosis on the base of efficient market behaviour.

So why would some rando - yours truly - troll these halls of wisdom with a random theory of what is going to happen? The answer is simple: That is what we do on WSB. Also, I have bullet points:

  
1st: The efficient market is dead. After the election massive amounts of retail investors have swept into the stock market and cryptocurrencies. According to [some video I saw on the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P03PfYgNjmw&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63B2lDhyKOsImI7FjCf6eDW&index=20) when large amounts of retail investors get into the market, the ""efficiency"" suffers, meaning, the market does not find the right prices for equities and beins to overprice them.

  
2nd. According to [another video on the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5PF2PcElV0&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63B2lDhyKOsImI7FjCf6eDW&index=19) (just coincidentally from the same ""youtuber"") the human brain is evolutionary not equipped, to stop greeding after more profit, once it started seeing progress. This is true for professional investors and even much more so for significantly less sophisticated individuals without the saftey net of a risk desk. This means the people, who stream into the stock market and cryptocurrencies right now, will not stop driving the prices up.

  
3rd. I´ve done my own research (watching those videos on the internet) and it says, that only two options stop us in those tracks: Learning through losses to take less risk and price more realistically or going broke. I find ""my research"" heavily supported in this subreddit.

  
4th. Market efficiency will further erode by currently unpredictable effects of an unknown, but likely rather disrupting policy. This will cause for some investors the pain, necessary to adapt or leave the market, for others it will cause massive gains, which will draw even more less sophistcated traders in.

  
5th. Given the limited sophistication, these investors are likely to focus on a limited range of assets, which are well represented in the media: AI and cryptocurrencies. This will lead to a continuing strong and overperforming bull run, drawing other investments up in it´s wake, but only on a limited scale.

  
6th. Companies will use this opportunity to launch extremely well doing IPOs.

  
7th. This bull run will end in a crash, because - according to my research on the internet and a couple of decades watching the hoax establishment news - it always does. Keep in mind, that this event does not necessarily have to happen in 2025.

  
8th. That market crash will wipe out massive amounts of wealth, ruin existences and make other filthy, filthy rich. Usually the latter are those, who were already filthy, filthy rich before. Unsophisticated investors will leave the market or be forced to leave and the markets become significantly more efficient again.

  
7th. Doing my own research means, I have to put foward conclusions. I weighed mine at least for several minutes while writing this text, so they are highly reliable predictions, but I still warn anybody from mistaking them for financial advice or antyhing else than demigodly prohecies:

  
\- The crash of the stock market will not lead to an extinction event, but a selection event. While companies will get wiped out, those, which survive will dominate the stock market just like the mag7 now, which are basically the survivors of the dotcom crash.

  
\- The crash of the cryptocurrency market will lead to an extinction event. It will wipe out most of cypto investors and funds/ETFs. This is due to the simple fact, that the market is way to much of a single economic niche. After that it may recover up to a point.

  
tl;dr: The efficient market is dead - long live the goldrush.","According to yahoo finance [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-forecasts-normal-year-for-stocks-in-2025-after-historic-rally-182124444.html) and [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-forecasts-p-500-054053974.html) several big financial institutions see the S&P moderating to a ""normal"" growth rate with the hype over AI starting to wane and a likely transition into other sectors.

\- The crash of the cryptocurrency market will lead to an extinction event. It will wipe out most of cypto investors and funds/ETFs. This is due to the simple fact, that the market is way to much of a single economic niche. After that it may recover up to a point.

  
tl;dr: The efficient market is dead - long live the goldrush.",105,77.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gusfdx/wallstreet_forecasts_normal_year_for_stocks_in/,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gusfdx/wallstreet_forecasts_normal_year_for_stocks_in/,reddit

Peak price: 510$

Its a good stock and is down -40% YTD. It has been climbing upwards slowly from its low of 235$ and could breakout more at some point soon. Expected to hit 400$ (looks like resistance) and climb higher if successful. It already seems to have broken the 300$ resistance. Everyone seems to be loading up on this stock at a discount (institutions and insiders). PE is 24.

Everytime it dips a lot, it seems to have a good rally afterwards and Nov-Jan is generally the time.

**1. What are the applications of SunHydrogen’s technology?**  
While our immediate focus is fuel cell vehicles, we recognize and embrace the vast possibilities for green hydrogen application. Long term, we envision that our technology can be utilized in industrial, residential and commercial settings, as well as feedstock for various petrochemicals and products.

**2. What is Gen 2 technology?**

Our Gen 2 technology, also known as our nanoparticle technology, brings lower costs, improved efficiency and scalable potential. Powered by solar energy, billions of our microscopic nanoparticles split apart water at the molecular level, extracting hydrogen for use as a clean energy source and leaving behind only clean oxygen as a byproduct.

**3. What is the company’s timeline for commercialization?**  
The timeline below outlines our progress toward the development and production phases of our technology. Projected targets are subject to change as we continue to engage new partners and identify the most efficient pathway to scale our technology.

* **SunH**
   * Small team
   * No factories, relatively low expenses
   * Patents covered worldwide
* **Partners** (laying out the infrastructure)
   * **HONDA**
   * CTF Solar GmbH (Germany/China): Thin-film production
      * This is a Chinese Top 200 company in Asia.
   * COTEC (Korea): Electroplating
   * Geomatec (Japan): Thin film tech
   * MSC (Korea): Thin film tech
   * Ionomr (Canada): Membranes
   * InRedox (US): Nano technology
   * Schmid (Germany): Panel design
   * Project NanoPEC (Germany): Access to 5/6 LEADING member companies
   * U of Iowa (US): R&D
   * U of Michigan (US): R&D
   * Various Consultants/Advisors: Worldwide
      * Among which 3 Japanese Drs, with thousands of citations worldwide.
* **CEO Statement**
   * **We believe our methodology for this completely homegrown multi-junction semiconductor will be the holy grail of green hydrogen production, and we are committed to making it happen:** Most recently, we have worked diligently to translate our lab-scale success to commercial scale with our partner COTEC of South Korea, a world leader in industrial electroplating and electrochemical processes, as well as with several German companies and institutions through Project NanoPEC.","**1.

Ok I know this is utterly false.  Markets were cutting new daily ATHs for two months after myself and a very lonely minority were going to cash prior to COVID.  We were mocked at perma-bulls kept seeing those new daily highs even as other countries were turning into morgues.  It took kooky events including NBA to trigger them to flip.



> It feels weird and doesn’t make any sense.

As suspected, you’re going off “feels weird” and the other historical revisionism above.

As for it “doesn’t make sense”, there are actually very sensible explanations if one has a wider and better informed perspective.

Taking profits at the end of a massive up year isn’t some secret conspiracy, it’s normal.  Also, “billions” in selling isn’t large.  There’s billions in selling every day.  Also, do you realize when there’s “billions in selling” that by definition means there were counterparties doing “billions in *buying*”?

It’s fine to consider things like metrics and sentiment, but you seem to be absorbing and embellishing a vibes-only narrative.","> This isn’t any ordinary selling,

Walmart has a wider product selection outside of a few niche products you can only find at target. Targets in house brand’s (good and gather, etc) are higher quality than Walmart’s for most products.

The biggest differentiator in Target’s favor is the shopping experience. Walmart checkout lines are equivalent to the 9th circle of hell when it’s busy at all. It can be hell even if it’s not busy.

Podcasts and videos can be found in the wiki here - [Podcasts and videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/medialist)

If you know nothing about the capital markets - the Getting Started section at the SEC educational site can be a good place to start - [investor.gov](https://investor.gov) \- there are also short 30 second videos on basics. The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is a US regulator with a focus to protect US investors through regulatory oversight of the securities markets.

The FINRA education site at [FINRA Education](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest) also contains numerous free courses and educational materials. FINRA is a not-for-profit SRO (self regulatory organization) which is self-funded by it's members which are broker-dealers. It works under the supervision of the SEC with a mandate to protect the investing public against fraud and bad practice.

For formal educational materials, several colleges and universities make their course work available for free.

I've started going to Walmart more when I know what I want, since they have a dozen working self checkout stations. The Target on the other hand since Covid has had only 4 self checkouts with 1 of them broken almost every time, and a line to use those self checkouts.

Out that put now at .69 cuz 69 duh and fuck holding that overnight. 

Anyway here's a little mini DD earnings brainstorm for you fools.

I'm looking at next week's earnings+mid caps at 52wk lows... 

KSS man have you guys looked at Kohl's chart?? It looks like dogshit at a glance ngl. 3yr weekly chart is down from the low 60s to just 16.50ish. It's just hit a 3 year low of 16.12 TODAY. 

One neat wrinkle is they have an exdiv date upcoming (12/11/24) for a 0.50/share dividend! Yeah that's right. That's like 3% UP FRONT. Shut up and take my money already! 

Looking at the KSS 11/29 17C for around .70-.75/share or better and just drooling. Eh?? Ehh???","https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/ZtStY6rJ4b

2024-11-21,KO,investing,post,1gwlxsq,,,SEC Chair Gary Gensler to Depart Agency on January 20,"SEC Chair Gary Gensler to Depart Agency on January 20
Washington D.C., Nov. 21, 2024 —

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that its 33rd Chair, Gary Gensler, will step down from the Commission effective at 12:00 pm on January 20, 2025. Chair Gensler began his tenure on April 17, 2021, in the immediate aftermath of the GameStop market events. He led the agency through a robust rulemaking agenda to enhance efficiency, resiliency, and integrity in the U.S. capital markets. He also oversaw high-impact enforcement cases to hold wrongdoers accountable and return billions to harmed investors.

“The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” said Chair Gensler. “The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world.

“I thank President Biden for entrusting me with this incredible responsibility. The SEC has met our mission and enforced the law without fear or favor. I’ve greatly enjoyed working with my fellow Commissioners, Allison Herren Lee, Elad Roisman, Hester Peirce, Caroline Crenshaw, Mark Uyeda, and Jaime Lizárraga. I also thank Congress, my colleagues across the U.S. government, and fellow regulators around the world.”

**Treasury Markets**

During Chair Gensler’s tenure, the SEC adopted critical enhancements to the $28 trillion U.S. Treasury markets. To lower cost and risk in the Treasury markets, the agency adopted rules to promote central clearing and narrow circumstances in which broker-dealers are exempt from national securities association registration. These reforms will lower risk and enhance efficiency throughout the entirety of the U.S. capital markets.

**Equity Markets**

Under Chair Gensler, the SEC made the first significant updates to the $55 trillion U.S. equity market in nearly 20 years. The agency unanimously made updates to the National Market System so that stocks can be traded more efficiently with narrower spreads and lower fees. Improvements also include shortening the settlement cycle to one day, which is good for investors and lowers risk in the market. Further, the agency unanimously adopted rules to update information regarding brokers’ execution quality. These reforms benefit investors by making equity markets more efficient.

**Resiliency**

The Commission adopted amendments during Chair Gensler’s tenure regarding Form PF, the confidential reporting form for certain SEC-registered investment advisers to private funds. The amended rules require that large hedge fund and private equity fund advisers make current reports on certain events to the Commission. The SEC further amended Form PF jointly with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to improve the quality of the information the agencies receive from all Form PF filers, and those changes will be implemented next year. Finally, the Commission adopted reforms to money market funds to make them more resilient, liquid, and transparent, including in times of stress.

**Corporate Governance**

To better promote trust in the capital markets, the SEC under Chair Gensler adopted a number of changes regarding corporate governance, including updating the rules for when corporate insiders can sell their shares, for when executives have to give back compensation based on erroneously reported financials, and for disclosure of executive pay versus performance. The agency also adopted new rules to allow shareholders to vote their preferred mix of board candidates on universal proxy cards in contested director elections. Additionally, the Commission adopted rules requiring more timely disclosure by those who are seeking control and buy more than a 5 percent stake in a company.

**Disclosure**

Since April 2021, the Commission has adopted several rules to ensure that investors get the disclosure they need from public companies and companies seeking to go public, broker-dealers, and investment advisors.

First, the Commission adopted rules to enhance disclosure around public company issuers’ cyber and climate risks, as well as for those companies seeking to go public via a special purpose acquisition company. The rules are grounded in materiality, as investors need this information to make buying, selling, holding, and voting decisions.

Second, the Commission adopted rules requiring certain broker-dealers and investment advisers to notify customers of data breaches that might put personal information at risk.

Finally, the Commission enhanced transparency to the markets by regularly publishing aggregate, anonymized data regarding registered investment funds, private funds, and investment advisers.

**Accounting and Auditing**

During Chair Gensler’s tenure, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), overseen by the SEC, successfully negotiated a Statement of Protocol with Chinese market authorities to allow the PCAOB to fully inspect and investigate, for the first time, the auditors of China-related companies listed in the United States. For the last two years, the PCAOB has been able to fulfill its inspection and enforcement-related responsibilities as it relates to audit firms in China and Hong Kong.

Further, in April 2021, the PCAOB had only updated five of the standards it adopted on an interim basis when it was created 20 years ago. The interim standards had been carried over from existing American Institute of Certified Public Accountants standards, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act envisioned that the PCAOB would update them soon after its creation. Since Chair Gensler was sworn in, the PCAOB has updated 18 interim standards and two other standards to reflect the current oversight needs in accounting and auditing.

**Examinations and Enforcement**

The Divisions of Enforcement and Examinations, which make up about half of the agency, have been steadfast cops on the beat during Chair Gensler’s tenure. The agency received more than 145,000 tips, complaints, and referrals and awarded approximately $1.5 billion to whistleblowers. The Commission filed more than 2,700 enforcement actions and obtained approximately $21 billion in penalties and disgorgement orders. Between fiscal years 2021 and 2024, the agency returned more than $2.7 billion to harmed investors as a result of enforcement actions.

Further, the SEC recovered more than $250 million for harmed investors through examination of investment advisors, investment companies, and broker dealers, among others. The Division of Examinations also enhanced communication with registrants by sharing more timely information about its annual priorities and observations and proactively engaging with industry and other regulators.

Under Chair Gensler, the Commission continued the work Chair Jay Clayton began to protect investors in the crypto markets. During Chair Gensler’s tenure, the agency brought actions against crypto intermediaries for fraud, wash trading, registration violations, and other misconduct.

In the last full fiscal year, according to the SEC’s Office of the Inspector General, 18 percent of the SEC’s tips, complaints, and referrals were crypto-related, despite the crypto markets comprising less than 1 percent of the U.S. capital markets. Court after court [agreed](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pli-s-56th-annual-institute-securities-regulation-111424#_ftn37) with the Commission’s actions to protect investors and rejected all arguments that the SEC cannot enforce the law when securities are being offered—whatever their form.

[https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-182](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-182)","Washington D.C., Nov. 21, 2024 —

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that its 33rd Chair, Gary Gensler, will step down from the Commission effective at 12:00 pm on January 20, 2025. Chair Gensler began his tenure on April 17, 2021, in the immediate aftermath of the GameStop market events. He led the agency through a robust rulemaking agenda to enhance efficiency, resiliency, and integrity in the U.S. capital markets. He also oversaw high-impact enforcement cases to hold wrongdoers accountable and return billions to harmed investors.

“The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” said Chair Gensler. “The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world.

“I thank President Biden for entrusting me with this incredible responsibility. The SEC has met our mission and enforced the law without fear or favor. I’ve greatly enjoyed working with my fellow Commissioners, Allison Herren Lee, Elad Roisman, Hester Peirce, Caroline Crenshaw, Mark Uyeda, and Jaime Lizárraga. I also thank Congress, my colleagues across the U.S. government, and fellow regulators around the world.”

**Treasury Markets**

During Chair Gensler’s tenure, the SEC adopted critical enhancements to the $28 trillion U.S. Treasury markets. To lower cost and risk in the Treasury markets, the agency adopted rules to promote central clearing and narrow circumstances in which broker-dealers are exempt from national securities association registration. These reforms will lower risk and enhance efficiency throughout the entirety of the U.S. capital markets.

**Equity Markets**

Under Chair Gensler, the SEC made the first significant updates to the $55 trillion U.S. equity market in nearly 20 years. The agency unanimously made updates to the National Market System so that stocks can be traded more efficiently with narrower spreads and lower fees. Improvements also include shortening the settlement cycle to one day, which is good for investors and lowers risk in the market. Further, the agency unanimously adopted rules to update information regarding brokers’ execution quality. These reforms benefit investors by making equity markets more efficient.

Hey guys, wanting to get some advice on a Roth IRA. Concept is mostly geared towards dividends with a couple opportunities for growth stocks.

Mostly looking for general advice or ideas. I like the value of TSM, but not sold on it 100%. 

AGNC 25%
ALLY 16%
KMI 16%
KO 16%
TSM 25%

This allocation would generate an approximate dividend yield of +/-6%.

Goal was to diversify and create dividend growth with some growth stocks in there, too.

Yet a few weeks back his team wrote a report predicting stock market returns baseline expectation was for 3% over the next decade. Does anyone know how they are reconciling those positions.

If you are new to investing, you can find curated resources in the r/investing wiki for [Getting Started here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/gettingstarted/). 

The reading list in the wiki and FAQ has a list of books ranging from light reading to advanced topics depending on your knowledge level. Link here - [Reading List](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/readinglist)

Podcasts and videos can be found in the wiki here - [Podcasts and videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/medialist)

If you know nothing about the capital markets - the Getting Started section at the SEC educational site can be a good place to start - [investor.gov](https://investor.gov) \- there are also short 30 second videos on basics. The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is a US regulator with a focus to protect US investors through regulatory oversight of the securities markets.

The FINRA education site at [FINRA Education](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest) also contains numerous free courses and educational materials. FINRA is a not-for-profit SRO (self regulatory organization) which is self-funded by it's members which are broker-dealers. It works under the supervision of the SEC with a mandate to protect the investing public against fraud and bad practice.

For formal educational materials, several colleges and universities make their course work available for free. 

If want to learn about the financial markets - an older but reasonably relevant course is [Financial Markets (2011) - Yale University](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8FB14A2200B87185) This is the introduction to financial markets course taught by Prof. Shiller from Yale. Prof Shiller won the Nobel prize in economics in 2013.

You need a good broker, a good method to transfer money to reduce bank costs and a method to reduce your tax.
The rest is up to you, education, brankroll, risk management, safety margin, psychology, etc.
Autors to consider: Andre Kostolany, Morgan Housel, Benjamin Graham, Nicholas Taleb, ... it's time consuming to read, but worth every hour. You need to learn strategies, but most of them will not work, because outdated and most people are using the wrong strategy in the wrong time.
Those, for example, SP500 ETFs are for people who don't invest much time into financial education, which is good for average people and especially for your start (now the reddit and youtube kids will downvote), but it's not interesting for a investor who makes +5k$/month on average. But this is only working in good times when we have a bull market, the times can change out of a sudden and bad times will come sooner or later. These ETFs don't work with investments less than 2k$/month, except if you live 200 years. Actually it depends on which goals you have. If you just want something solid for retirement, then go for it (in Germany you have ""Pension"", where some amount is automatically cut from your salary, by law, and put into the gov's pension fund. So you already have it. But if you move to US, then the ETF makes sense). But don't call yourself an investor.
I made a good expirience with something I started just for fun: Do the exact opposit of the suggestions here on reddit and it worked well. Most so called investors are not successful - keep that in mind.","With this little information nobody here can give you a serious answer.

2024-11-23,KO,stocks,comment,1gx8xtj,lykbluo,t3_1gx8xtj,,"""Do you know of some other companies targeted by mulriple short sellers In the past""

There's been plenty of companies targeted by shorts in the past that went to 0. Most of the Lampert era of Sears was a long vs short saga that lasted over a decade - it eventually was largely Lampert and former ""Morningstar Manager of the Decade"" Berkowitz on one side and the shorts on the other. There were tremendous short squeezes at times in Sears all the way down, but the closer it go to 0 the shorter they lasted. There were people posting at $2 that ""Eddie Lampert is a billionaire, he has a plan!"" Yes, he did - a plan for himself loaning the company money against the company's best real estate - heads I win, tails I win. It went from Business Week covers talking about how Lampert was going to create his Berkshire Hathway to eventual bankruptcy.

I think that we're in an odd period where things have turned into memes or recovered in a fashion that would otherwise be unusual in the past. AMC has been able to dilute shareholders incessantly. If this was several years ago, it probably would have been a 0 already rather than the meme boost and the constant equity raises after that have been tolerated. Yellow went bankrupt then went up 600% before cratering. There are people who still think that Bed Bath and Beyond's bankruptcy is a massive conspiracy. SAVEQ seems to be the latest in the line of these - Gamestop's short squeeze seems to have taught a generation of investors that ""bad is not bad"", every poorly run company/mediocre business is a potential meme/short squeeze and anyone who has a different opinion is somehow conspiring against them. 

In investing sometimes people are going to have differing opinions than you about your investments. Sometimes those people are going to have bigger platforms to broadcast their views. Sometimes those people are going to be right. Sometimes those people aren't right but maybe you read what they have to say and they make some good points - they aren't ultimately right but some of it makes you think and see your investment perhaps in ways you previously haven't. If you read what they have to say and still think you're right, you thank them for the opportunity and buy lower.

Investing is a life long learning experience and imo, people should be open to maybe learning from people who don't share the same opinion. 

It's really only the last 5 years that any time there's a short discussion people run and post about ""MANIPULATION!!!"" Meanwhile, what would those people say if they were short the stock and the report was someone who was long? People have less ire towards pump and dump scams (hot quantum computing stock QUBT was ""Innovative Beverage Company"" not that long ago - keep in mind Long Island Iced Tea renaming itself Long Blockchain wasn't that many years ago) than they do towards someone who has a negative opinion on a popular retail long.  It's the Simpsons meme: ""Could I be wrong?"" ""No, it must be a short seller conspiracy.""

Not everyone is going to share your opinion on your investments and be open to the idea that maybe they can make an interesting point you hadn't considered or be right. People rant about how any sort of short anything is ""manipulation"" but we're in a time period where people seem far less tolerant in investing to any opinion that isn't theirs. There was a time where Reddit wasn't full of little echo chamber stock-specific subreddits where people go to hear everyone agree with them and people could have differing opinions on here and it actually sometimes lead to good discussions rather than just insta-downvotes and/or being scolded for not agreeing with a prevailing trend/opinion on something.

 If you read what they have to say and still disagree, thank them for the opportunity and buy more - that's it. If you have to post to confirm whether to invest or not, maybe you're not as confident in the business as you need to be.","""Do you know of some other companies targeted by mulriple short sellers In the past""

Good day my fellow redditers...
I'm considering to invest $200 every month on a stock and forget about it. Seeking to withdraw anytime in the future (20 years or more) which option you guys think could be the best between these two: KO or FSPGX? 
Ko is expensive to buy considering g 200 a month but will return steady income with dividends. 
While FSPGX is more affordable, no considerable dividends but it could grow.

I enrolled in SoFi savings because of the superior interest rates and I was curious. From there I realized their CC had better cash back than by BAC CC so I switched my credit card over.

I believe ASML hasn’t been doing business with China due to pre existing sanctions, unless it’s in a roundabout way through South Korean companies like LAM and AMAT have been doing.  Hence why SMIC is still three generations behind on their chips and Huawei is still putting 7nm into their newest phones (although it’s rumored that a 3rd party has been selling them 6nm).

I wouldn’t be shocked to see if American pick and shovel companies continue to route business through allied Asian countries to China going forward.  AMAT has already had a subpoena dropped on them earlier in the year for selling semi material to China.","Ehhh this may be just temporarily bad for AMAT.  A lot of this has already been priced in as the sanctions/Chip War with China has been running pretty hot lately.   

I believe ASML hasn’t been doing business with China due to pre existing sanctions, unless it’s in a roundabout way through South Korean companies like LAM and AMAT have been doing.

Humans do wars. At least 150 ongoing armed conflicts have been recorded each year recently. Every war ends sooner or later and it is time to clean mess and move on. 

In addition to human losses there are always lands contaminated with bullets, mines, grenades, projectiles, part of rockets, etc. Some of them still dangerous decades after conflict is over. It used to be job exclusively for sappers, elite combat engineers, risking their lives to demine post-conflict territories. Then in 2000's we moved to drones gathering information from air and human analyzing it on the ground.   
Now it is time for Artificial Intelligence and drones do all the work.

""[Is the internet good in Germany? Is it a good idea to work remotely in Germany?](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-internet-good-in-Germany-Is-it-a-good-idea-to-work-remotely-in-Germany)

That very much depends on where in Germany you are. Generally, Germany’s phone line system is vastly outdated. Before the mid-90s all phone lines belonged to the German federal postal service (Deutsche Bundespost) which had the monopoly and thus saw little need to innovate. When the monopoly fell and other providers like Mannesmann-Arcor joined the game, the infrastructure was updated very slowly. Even today, in older buildings in poorer parts of Germany, all you have is the old copper lines which allow a maximum transfer rate of 16MBits via conventional DSL…if you’re lucky. In richer parts you will find VDSL, cable and the likes. This is not only a rural vs. urban problem. It is also a problem of classic German conservativism. I live in the southern part of the city of Essen, part of the “Ruhrgebiet”, one of Germany’s most densely populated urban areas. When I moved into my new place I found that my connection was only 4MBits at best, but shaky. The Deutsche Telekom told me, my place was in an area scheduled for “further development”. Then they made a survey. And then the further development got cancelled. As the area where I live is populated with a lot of old people, care homes etc. there was just not enough demand for proper internet and the Telekom saw no point in investing a lot for a handful of people. This is why on my street the people living in houses with even numbers have VDSL with 50+MBits as their lines are fed through a new modern backbone, while the people living in houses with odd numbers cannot have anything above 16MBits depending on how far they are away from the DSLAM which is fed through ancient lines and sends its signal through copper lines from the mid—50s. There is also no cable tv as people are perfectly happy with their satellite dishes and thus no internet via cable. The cables are simply not there.""

Meanwhile here I am nearly 10 years using 1000mb internet with strong and stable connection always. And no, not in one place. During that 10 years 2 different countries in Center Europe and 7 different flats and 4 different providers in total. So not that I spent 10 years at the same place at the same provider, nor that I got lucky, simply other countries have more developed internet and finance tech even if the countries themselves on gdp and other level behind Germany (I'm just stating this that don't worry, of course you are still a great and economically rich country, just the use of paypal and not knowing tech/finance/internet stuff from the last 10 years is not shocking when on that front your are 20y behind todays)","And from your fellow German person on Quora answering on this topic:

It's just a fact that you guys kinda forgot on changing/developing your internet infrastructure, and if that got stuck from \~2010 levels then of course when it comes to neobanks you still use the one from 2010 era as well.

But anyways, look into Revolut. Been using them for 6 years, also worked 2 years for them, horrible working place, super toxic, don't recommend working for them, but the product is good and that one I recommend :) Even my dad is using it for years and he is about to turn 60 so even ""older generations"" find it good.","Yeah sorry you r the odd one in eu when it comes to such technology, thats my bad you are correct.

The other way to play that event would be just to sit and wait in short term paper ready to buy the dip at some kind of juicy juicy juicy interest rate of maybe 7? 9? 11%? I know call me crazy. 

Look im not sure and appreciate OP post on this because I scratch my head on this stuff. What is he waiting for? It’s probably not just one thing. But I believe buffet holds more short term debt than the fed reserve. So basically this is something well within his wheel house. Also with the market at an all time high and priced to perfection do we think the market will return 10% yoy for next 5 years? Maybe, maybe not. But if there is a bond panic you might be able to get treasuries at 7 or 8% essentially risk free for 5-10 years.","A lot of pretty smart guys are massively short the bond market.

As the new Trump administration takes office in 2025, we will all grapple with a rapidly evolving economic landscape. The anticipated policies promise significant shifts reminiscent of Hungary's economic transformation.   Please let me know if you agree or disagree with any of the picks below...

# Understanding the Policy Shifts

**1. Economic Nationalism and Protectionism**

The administration's ""America First"" agenda is expected to:

* **Increase Tariffs on Imports**: Tariffs could rise by 10-25%, mainly targeting Chinese goods. This move aims to protect domestic industries but may lead to higher consumer prices.
* **Promote Onshoring**: Incentives for companies to relocate manufacturing to the U.S. could include tax breaks and subsidies.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Beneficiaries**: Domestic manufacturers like **Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT)** and **3M Company (NYSE: MMM)** could see increased demand due to reduced competition from imports.
* **Potential Losers**: Companies reliant on imported materials or global supply chains like **Apple** may face higher production costs and supply-chain disruptions.

**2. Deregulation and Tax Cuts**

Anticipated measures include:

* **Corporate Tax Reductions**: Lowering the rate from 21% to 15% could significantly boost net earnings.
* **Deregulation Efforts**: Especially in energy and finance, rolling back regulations like Dodd-Frank could reshape industry operations.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Financial Sector Gains**: Banks like **JPMorgan Chase** and **Goldman Sachs** might experience increased profitability due to relaxed lending regulations and lower taxes.
* **Energy Sector Surge**: Traditional oil and gas companies like **Exxon Mobil Corporation** and **Chevron Corporation** could benefit from reduced environmental regulations and expanded drilling rights.

**3. Increased Government Intervention**

Potential actions:

* **Sector-Specific Policies**: Favoring industries aligned with national priorities, possibly leading to subsidies for sectors like defense and infrastructure.
* **Unpredictable Regulatory Changes**: Sudden policy shifts could affect long-term planning and investment.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Defense Contractors Advantage**: Companies like **Lockheed Martin** and **Northrop Grumman** may secure lucrative government contracts amid increased defense spending.
* **Risk of Cronyism**: Firms with close ties to the administration could outperform, while others may struggle to compete.

# What Lessons Can We Learn from Hungary Under Viktor Orbán

* **Nationalization and Heavy Taxation**: Foreign companies faced significant taxes, reducing foreign investment.
* **Favoritism Towards Domestic Firms**: Companies aligned with government objectives received advantages, distorting competition.
* **Market Volatility**: Unpredictable policies led to investor uncertainty and capital flight.

**Application to the U.S. Context:**

* **Regulatory Risk**: Investors should be wary of sudden policy changes that could impact sectors like technology and healthcare.
* **Importance of Government Relations**: Companies investing in government lobbying and aligning with national priorities may fare better.

# Sector-Specific Investment Opportunities and Risks

**1. Sectors Poised for Growth**

* **Energy Sector**
   * *Analysis*: With deregulation and a focus on energy independence, traditional energy companies will likely expand operations.
   * *Investment Picks*: Consider **Halliburton** for oilfield services and **Phillips 66** for refining and midstream operations.
   * *Commodities Impact*: Expect a potential rise in crude oil prices due to increased domestic demand, making investments in oil futures or ETFs like the **United States Oil Fund LP (NYSEARCA: USO)** attractive.
* **Financial Services**
   * *Analysis*: Deregulation could lead to increased lending and investment banking activities.
   * *Investment Picks*: Regional banks like **(NYSE: PNC)** may benefit from economic growth and deregulation.
* **Defense and Infrastructure**
   * *Analysis*: Increased government spending in defense and infrastructure projects.
   * *Investment Picks*: Infrastructure companies like **(NYSE: VMC)** and **Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM)** could see increased demand for construction materials.

**2. Sectors Facing Headwinds**

* **Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals**
   * *Analysis*: Potential reforms aiming to reduce drug prices could squeeze profit margins.
   * *Investment Risks*: Companies like **Pfizer** and **Merck** may face pricing pressures.
   * *Considerations*: Biotech firms focusing on innovative treatments may be less impacted.
* **Renewable Energy**
   * *Analysis*: A shift away from climate initiatives could reduce subsidies and support for renewable energy projects.
   * *Investment Risks*: Companies like **First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR)** and **NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE)** might experience slowed growth.
   * *Commodities Impact*: Potential decrease in demand for renewable energy commodities like lithium and rare earth elements.
* **Technology and Multinationals**
   * *Analysis*: Tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt global supply chains.
   * *Investment Risks*: Tech giants like **Microsoft** and **Alphabet** might face international market challenges.

# Navigating Market Volatility

**Strategies to Mitigate Risks:**

* **Defensive Stocks**: Consider utilities and consumer staples companies like **The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG)** and **Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE: DUK)**, which tend to be more stable during market fluctuations.
* **Gold and Precious Metals**: Historically seen as a haven, investing in gold through **SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA: GLD)** or mining companies like **Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: GOLD)** can hedge against volatility.

# Exploring International Investment Opportunities

**Emerging Markets Resilience:**

* **India**
   * *Analysis*: With a domestic solid growth trajectory, India is less exposed to U.S. policy changes.
   * *Investment Picks*: **HDFC Bank Limited (NYSE: HDB)** offers exposure to India's growing middle class.
* **Taiwan and South Korea**
   * *Analysis*: Key semiconductor and AI supply chain players are potentially insulated from U.S.-China trade tensions.
   * *Investment Picks*: **Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd**.

**Other Potential Diversification Plays:**

* **International ETFs**: Investing in funds like **iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA: EEM)** provides broad exposure to emerging markets.
* **Commodities**: Diversifying with commodities like copper and nickel, essential for global infrastructure and technology, can capitalize on international demand.","As the new Trump administration takes office in 2025, we will all grapple with a rapidly evolving economic landscape.

* **Corporate Tax Reductions**: Lowering the rate from 21% to 15% could significantly boost net earnings.
* **Deregulation Efforts**: Especially in energy and finance, rolling back regulations like Dodd-Frank could reshape industry operations.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Financial Sector Gains**: Banks like **JPMorgan Chase** and **Goldman Sachs** might experience increased profitability due to relaxed lending regulations and lower taxes.
* **Energy Sector Surge**: Traditional oil and gas companies like **Exxon Mobil Corporation** and **Chevron Corporation** could benefit from reduced environmental regulations and expanded drilling rights.

**3. Increased Government Intervention**

Potential actions:

* **Sector-Specific Policies**: Favoring industries aligned with national priorities, possibly leading to subsidies for sectors like defense and infrastructure.
* **Unpredictable Regulatory Changes**: Sudden policy shifts could affect long-term planning and investment.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Defense Contractors Advantage**: Companies like **Lockheed Martin** and **Northrop Grumman** may secure lucrative government contracts amid increased defense spending.
* **Risk of Cronyism**: Firms with close ties to the administration could outperform, while others may struggle to compete.

# What Lessons Can We Learn from Hungary Under Viktor Orbán

* **Nationalization and Heavy Taxation**: Foreign companies faced significant taxes, reducing foreign investment.
* **Favoritism Towards Domestic Firms**: Companies aligned with government objectives received advantages, distorting competition.
* **Market Volatility**: Unpredictable policies led to investor uncertainty and capital flight.

**Application to the U.S. Context:**

* **Regulatory Risk**: Investors should be wary of sudden policy changes that could impact sectors like technology and healthcare.
* **Importance of Government Relations**: Companies investing in government lobbying and aligning with national priorities may fare better.

# Sector-Specific Investment Opportunities and Risks

**1. Sectors Poised for Growth**

* **Energy Sector**
   * *Analysis*: With deregulation and a focus on energy independence, traditional energy companies will likely expand operations.
   * *Investment Picks*: Consider **Halliburton** for oilfield services and **Phillips 66** for refining and midstream operations.
   * *Commodities Impact*: Expect a potential rise in crude oil prices due to increased domestic demand, making investments in oil futures or ETFs like the **United States Oil Fund LP (NYSEARCA: USO)** attractive.
* **Financial Services**
   * *Analysis*: Deregulation could lead to increased lending and investment banking activities.
   * *Investment Picks*: Regional banks like **(NYSE: PNC)** may benefit from economic growth and deregulation.
* **Defense and Infrastructure**
   * *Analysis*: Increased government spending in defense and infrastructure projects.
   * *Investment Picks*: Infrastructure companies like **(NYSE: VMC)** and **Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM)** could see increased demand for construction materials.

**2. Sectors Facing Headwinds**

* **Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals**
   * *Analysis*: Potential reforms aiming to reduce drug prices could squeeze profit margins.
   * *Investment Risks*: Companies like **Pfizer** and **Merck** may face pricing pressures.
   * *Considerations*: Biotech firms focusing on innovative treatments may be less impacted.
* **Renewable Energy**
   * *Analysis*: A shift away from climate initiatives could reduce subsidies and support for renewable energy projects.
   * *Investment Risks*: Companies like **First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR)** and **NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE)** might experience slowed growth.
   * *Commodities Impact*: Potential decrease in demand for renewable energy commodities like lithium and rare earth elements.
* **Technology and Multinationals**
   * *Analysis*: Tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt global supply chains.
   * *Investment Risks*: Tech giants like **Microsoft** and **Alphabet** might face international market challenges.

# Navigating Market Volatility

**Strategies to Mitigate Risks:**

* **Defensive Stocks**: Consider utilities and consumer staples companies like **The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG)** and **Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE: DUK)**, which tend to be more stable during market fluctuations.
* **Gold and Precious Metals**: Historically seen as a haven, investing in gold through **SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA: GLD)** or mining companies like **Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: GOLD)** can hedge against volatility.

# Exploring International Investment Opportunities

**Emerging Markets Resilience:**

* **India**
   * *Analysis*: With a domestic solid growth trajectory, India is less exposed to U.S. policy changes.
   * *Investment Picks*: **HDFC Bank Limited (NYSE: HDB)** offers exposure to India's growing middle class.
* **Taiwan and South Korea**
   * *Analysis*: Key semiconductor and AI supply chain players are potentially insulated from U.S.-China trade tensions.
   * *Investment Picks*: **Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd**.

**Other Potential Diversification Plays:**

* **International ETFs**: Investing in funds like **iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA: EEM)** provides broad exposure to emerging markets.
* **Commodities**: Diversifying with commodities like copper and nickel, essential for global infrastructure and technology, can capitalize on international demand.",1,21.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gyxypj/how_are_you_thinking_about_your_portfolio_given/,/r/investing/comments/1gyxypj/how_are_you_thinking_about_your_portfolio_given/,reddit

Like yes at least they are not driven by hype and so less grown to busts but well they have other issues, like let's take ibm. They were a humongous juggernaut and owned the IT of big companies but have been basically living on their past glory while the cloud revolution bypassed them. They have stayed profitable for decades by selling off pieces and firing people but well I assure you that won't continue for another 40 years. Adjusted for inflation their revenue is a bloodbath. It went from 88b in 1999 to inflation adjusted 30 (61 in 2023 usd ) in 2024. Others like Exxon are great companies in their area but well oil companies are not exactly the longterm 40 year future either.  That leaves companies like coca cola but well they are just really really expensive. So please don't invest in something you depend on over decades just because it has a cool name.

They were a humongous juggernaut and owned the IT of big companies but have been basically living on their past glory while the cloud revolution bypassed them. They have stayed profitable for decades by selling off pieces and firing people but well I assure you that won't continue for another 40 years. Adjusted for inflation their revenue is a bloodbath. It went from 88b in 1999 to inflation adjusted 30 (61 in 2023 usd ) in 2024. Others like Exxon are great companies in their area but well oil companies are not exactly the longterm 40 year future either.  That leaves companies like coca cola but well they are just really really expensive. So please don't invest in something you depend on over decades just because it has a cool name.

They rake in approx 4b per quarter, own 8.5b in real estate, offer a .50 div and teamed up with sephora and babyrus which are both 2b per quarter additions once they are fully open in all their stores and operating.

The reality is kohls makes and has made more money than 90% of the currently exploding growth stocks on the market right now, and when those fizzle out (some won't, some will make it) khols will still be raking in billions. 


Cava? That hundred billion dollar veggies bowl company? Khols makes 5 times as much as them per quarter. For some reason khols is under 2b market cap.

All because it isn't sexy.

It's at a 52 week low and I have been accumulating for like 3 years. 

A big issue was their debt, which they took to do the sephora/babyrus expansions. Well, rates are going down, they paid off a huge amount of the debt last quarter, and have none coming due for 2 more years.  They are also exploring buybacks, which is a good idea considering how cheap they are 

They are at a .11 P/s and a 12% div yield and have literally zero chance of BK.

THIS WILL EVENTUALLY MAKE ME A MILLIONAIRE.

 I just can't tell when. 

In a sick way, I am hoping for a loss this quarter so the market will sell me their shares at a huge discount.","That may be your experience, but the numbers don't lie.

**Investment Report**

Before you start reading the report, I want to clarify that this is not a deep dive into Kohl's. Instead, I focus on a few key aspects that could affect the share price in the short to medium term, as this is the information most of you are interested in. Kohl's is not a great long-term hold; however, it is a special situation that could deliver some gains.

**Key points:**

* **High Short Interest:** Over 40% of the float is shorted, making Kohl's a prime candidate for a short squeeze if positive catalysts emerge.
* **Partnerships Driving Growth:** Collaborations with Sephora and Babies ""R"" Us aim to boost revenue and traffic.
* **Upcoming Catalysts:** Quarterly results, a potentially stronger holiday season, and a possible share repurchase program could drive short-term gains.
* **Valuable Real Estate Holdings**: $10 billion in net property, plant, and equipment supports the company, limiting downside risk. 

# 1.    Investment thesis:

This investment thesis on Kohl's Corporation is undoubtedly a controversial one, but the opportunity it presents is surprisingly straightforward. At first glance, Kohl's appears to be a failing company: declining revenues, shrinking profits, and operating within a challenged retail sector. These factors have led to an alarmingly high short interest of over 40%. In today's market environment, with booming opportunities in tech and high opportunity costs, Kohl's seems like an easy target for short sellers.

However, what many investors may overlook is that beneath its struggling operations, Kohl's holds significant underlying value. The company owns approximately $10 billion in net property, plant, and equipment, and even after accounting for $5.4 billion in capital leases and $1.2 billion in long-term debt, the real estate value alone is higher than the current market valuation. This positions Kohl's with a tangible book value of $34.50 per share. Furthermore, Kohl's has embarked on a turnaround plan designed to stabilize declining revenues and improve margins—a plan we will analyze later.

Kohl's core business still has strength. With 1,176 stores across the United States, the recent addition of Sephora shops inside Kohl's locations has been a key element of their turnaround strategy. Additionally, the company boasts a strong customer base, with 20 million active app users and 30 million loyalty members—clear indicators that Kohl's is not on the verge of disappearing anytime soon.

Moreover, Kohl's has been actively working on reducing its debt load, with interest payments remaining manageable at a rate of 5.12%. The company’s unsecured loans have a Fitch debt rating of BB+, suggesting a credit profile that is far from signaling bankruptcy. Despite its challenges, Kohl's continues to pay a sustainable dividend of 12%, while maintaining enough cash flow to further reduce debt.

# 2.    Turnaround strategy:

Kohl's turnaround strategy revolves around leveraging its extensive real estate holdings to introduce new brands and services into its stores, thereby driving increased customer traffic. One key initiative in this strategy has been the partnership with Sephora, which has brought standalone Sephora shops inside Kohl's locations. This collaboration has shown promising results, contributing $1.3 billion in revenue for 2023 and is expected to reach $2 billion by 2025. Building on this success, Kohl's has also announced a partnership with Babies ""R"" Us, with plans to open 200 in-store shops in 2024. This, along with other growth initiatives, is expected to generate an additional $2 billion in revenue.

Another way Kohl's is working to boost sales is by improving the in-store shopping experience. For example, they have introduced queuing lines in certain locations, which appears to be enhancing customer satisfaction and potentially increasing sales. Kohl's also aims to return to an operating margin of 7-8%, reflecting their focus on profitability as part of the turnaround.

In addition to retail partnerships, Kohl's is expanding its credit card business, although the significance of this effort in determining long-term growth may be limited. On a positive note, despite lower overall revenues, Kohl's has managed to maintain and even slightly grow its gross margins, showcasing operational resilience amid challenging circumstances.

The company remains committed to paying down its debt and building up its cash reserves, positioning itself for potential share repurchases once financial stability is further strengthened. However, it's worth noting that Kohl's has revised its yearly guidance downward every quarter, contributing to a more pessimistic outlook from investors. Despite this, long-term stock incentives for management offer a degree of alignment with shareholder interests, providing some reason for optimism.

Overall, Kohl's turnaround strategy is focused on maximizing its existing assets, strengthening key partnerships, and improving operational efficiency to restore profitability and shareholder value.



# 3.    Catalysts:

Kohl's presents a potentially significant opportunity, albeit one that could easily become a value trap—something that has been the case for years. However, I would not consider investing in the stock without some compelling catalysts that could lead to a major revaluation, possibly triggering a short squeeze. With the quarterly results presentation set for tomorrow, short interest has increased, leading to a decline in the share price amid lower trading volumes. The current market pricing reflects a worst-case scenario, with over 40% of the float being shorted. In this environment, even a slight positive surprise could cause the stock to surge.

The first key catalyst is the upcoming quarterly results. If Kohl's posts results that are even slightly better than Wall Street expectations, this could drive a significant rally in the share price, fueled in part by the high short interest. In the medium term, a stronger-than-anticipated holiday season could also provide a boost. There are early indications that this might be the case—for example, other retail brands like GAP have raised their full-year guidance due to strong holiday outlooks, suggesting positive consumer sentiment for the season.

In addition to these near-term catalysts, Kohl's is likely to initiate a share repurchasing program in the medium term, which could be the most impactful catalyst of all. A buyback program would create additional upward pressure on the stock price, forcing short sellers to cover their positions and potentially creating a short squeeze.

Overall, there are several catalysts that could lead to a significant appreciation in Kohl's share price in the short to medium term. While the market could still be wrong and the stock may continue to face headwinds, the downside seems limited at current levels, as Kohl's remains an attractive acquisition target for either another retailer or a private equity firm interested in its valuable real estate assets.

# 4.    Conclusion:

Kohl's is not a great company—not even close to being considered a good one—but it represents a special situation that could yield substantial returns with limited long-term downside risk, thanks to its cash flows and valuable real estate assets. Whether this investment pays off or if I am simply being misled by management remains to be seen. However, it's important to remember that being a contrarian can be highly rewarding, even if it means accepting the possibility of losing on most bets.

A comparable opportunity that comes to mind is my investment in Geo Group, where I bought shares at around $8. With short interest at 25%, the company offered strong cash flows and significant asset value that protected the downside. That stock is now trading at $28, less than two years later. While I don't expect a similar trajectory for Kohl's, it still offers several short- to medium-term opportunities for those willing to be greedy when others are fearful.

Listen up folks, we are all in awe as to how CVNA made a turnaround, we literally thought it was going to the dumpster, but it didn't. I present to you the next possible stock turnaround, CHGG. If you check the daily chart, it has made a huge breakout coming from the bottomless pit it had delved for many months/years, something is up. Multiple bear calls has been made against this stock from a f ew years ago mainly because of AI, but mind you, CHGG has its own AI now and dwells more on a specific niche that its really good at.

I am a true blue regard, I don't do due diligence, I let others do it, and I let my intuition and whatever brain cells I have in this tiny head of mine decide whether it is legit or not. I found a really good and honest DD regarding this ticker, its really worth a read, twitter post with this link:

Listen up, regards! It's time to strap on your helmets and buckle up for a wild ride with Polestar (PSNY). This Swedish EV maker is about to make your wife's boyfriend jealous.

## The Good Shit

- Polestar just dropped their Q2 2024 results, and holy shit, they're delivering cars faster than your wife delivers disappointment. 82% growth in global deliveries, with 13,150 cars shipped out in Q2 alone[1].

- They've got a new CEO, Michael Lohscheller, coming in hot on October 1st. This guy's been around the block, running Opel, VinFast, and Nikola. He knows how to handle a stick shift, if you know what I mean[1].

- Polestar's got a lineup that'll make Tesla fanboys cry. We're talking five performance EVs by 2026, including the Polestar 3 (SUV for the electric age) and Polestar 4 (SUV coupé that'll make you question your sexuality)[1].

## The Not-So-Good Shit

- Revenue's down by $319.6 million. But who needs money when you've got swag, right?[1]

- They're posting losses, but that's just because they're playing 4D chess while the rest of the market is playing checkers[1].

- The stock's been bouncing around like a kangaroo on meth. It's currently sitting at $1.65, down from its 52-week high of $2.65[2].

## The ""Trust Me Bro"" Analysis

Polestar's making moves faster than your wife's boyfriend after a few beers. They've secured up to $300 million in additional external funding[1]. That's like finding loose change in your couch, but the couch is made of money.

The company's aiming for a climate-neutral production car by 2030[1]. That's some next-level hippie shit that'll make the tree-huggers throw their wallets at Polestar faster than you can say ""save the whales.""

## The YOLO Play

Analysts are saying ""Hold"" with a price target of $1.64[2]. But we're not here to hold, we're here to ride this Swedish rocket to the moon! 

The stock's trading at $1.65 now, but with their Q3 earnings coming up on November 26th[2], this could be your chance to buy the dip before it rips.

Remember, this isn't financial advice. I eat crayons for breakfast and my brain is smoother than a baby's bottom. But if you've got balls of Swedish steel and a taste for electric tendies, PSNY might just be your ticket to Valhalla.

Now go forth and YOLO, you beautiful degenerates!

2024-11-25,KO,stocks,comment,1gz8wmi,lyup33r,t1_lyuna82,,"The investment into tesla made sense tbh:

1. I truly believe the future is in electric vehicles, and tesla is definitely the current leader is such technology. It's the same reason I put money into toyota, as they're touting new battery technology that, if found to be viable to the consumer market, could give us 800 mile range and 10 minute charge time at a reasonable price.

2. As much as I may not like the current political situation...Elon musk is in the orbit of the leader of the next administration; an administration that seems pretty open about their plans to deregulate large businesses. Elon's companies have everything to gain, so i figured it was pretty sound lol


I know you weren't specifically asking, but just giving some insight. I see why everyone is saying I picked companies at random...at some points I did. But most of it is based off of at least partial understanding of what's going on. For example, amphenol makes fiber-optic cables for the automotive iindustry, and TKO is currently killing it with UFC's incessant popularity and WWE's resurgence.

The comments are truly helping though, as it's seeming pretty sound that I've gone about this the wrong way, even if the intentions were solid. I think I'll keep putting money into the s&p, and kinda keep the automotive stuff in consideration lol. Thanks for your comment homie

(Didn't mean any ill-will from my reply BTW, unsure if it came off as such but still lol)","The investment into tesla made sense tbh:

This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on technical analysis (TA), but if TA is not your thing then just ignore the theme.

Some helpful day to day links, including news:

* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks
* [Bloomberg market news](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets)
* StreetInsider news:
  * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips
  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news

-----

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

2024-11-26,KO,wallstreetbets,post,1h0lkh3,,,"Red Cat Holdings, Inc. (RCAT) Due Diligence Report  ","Red Cat Holdings, Inc. (RCAT) Due Diligence Report  
**Company Overview**

Red Cat Holdings, Inc. is a technology company specializing in the development of drone systems and solutions for military and commercial applications. In response to the United States renewing bans on DJI drones through legislation such as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and the American Security Drone Act, Red Cat focuses on providing advanced, domestically produced unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and related technologies. The company's products aim to enhance drone operations while addressing national security concerns by supplying secure, American-made drone solutions. Through its subsidiaries, including **Teal Drones** and **FlightWave**, Red Cat offers products that support reconnaissance, surveillance, and other critical functions, delivering innovative solutions to defense organizations and industries requiring drone capabilities[.](https://imgur.com/a/8E9PtMl)

**Investment Thesis**

Jeff Thompson, CEO of Red Cat Holdings, has outlined significant developments that position the company for substantial growth and potential undervaluation in the market. The following points highlight the company's strategic advantages and growth prospects, incorporating recent developments from the company's earnings call and industry dynamics.

# 1. Significant U.S. Army Contract

**SRR Program Win**

* **Contract Award**: Red Cat's subsidiary, **Teal Drones**, has been selected as the sole winner of the U.S. Army's **Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) program**, securing a contract to deliver **5,880 systems**. Each system includes **two drones and one controller**, amounting to a total of **11,760 drones**.
* **Contract Value**: The average price of a system is around **$45,000**, depending on configuration. This implies a base contract value of approximately **$264 million**.
* **Competitive Edge**: Teal Drones was chosen over better-funded competitors like Skydio, which has raised over **$700 million** in venture capital. Despite being an underdog, Teal's technological advancements and ability to meet the Army's stringent requirements led to this significant win.

**Additional Revenue Streams**

* **Maintenance and Support**: The contract includes provisions for repairs, training, and spare parts, which could increase the contract's value by an additional **50-70%**. Historically, programs of record have seen significant revenue from spares and support over many years.
* **Expansion Potential**: The SRR program's success positions Red Cat to secure additional contracts with other military branches, U.S. government agencies, and NATO allies.

**Program of Record Status**

* **Simplified Procurement**: Achieving **Program of Record** status streamlines the procurement process for other defense organizations, allowing them to purchase directly off the SRR contract. This designation enhances credibility and accelerates additional orders and long-term partnerships.

# 2. Anticipated Growth and Revenue Projections

**Projected Revenues**

* **Fiscal Year Projections**: The company has provided guidance of **$50-55 million** for calendar year 2025, based on the initial phases of the SRR contract.
* **Potential Upside**: With additional appropriations and the possibility of accelerated procurement, revenues could increase significantly. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes approximately **$79.5 million** in funding for the program line that supports SRR.
* **Long-Term Outlook**: Including potential additional contracts and support services, annual revenues could reach around **$100 million**, excluding new contracts.

**Future Contracts**

* **International Demand**: NATO allies and other international partners have shown strong interest in the Black Widow drone, especially after the SRR program win. Some opportunities may eclipse the SRR program in size and value.
* **Expansion into Asia-Pacific**: The company is also engaging with Asian allies, such as Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, the Philippines, and South Korea, to explore additional sales opportunities.
* **Replicator Initiative Participation**: Red Cat is involved in the Department of Defense's **Replicator program** to mass-produce affordable, autonomous drones, potentially leading to larger future contracts.

# 3. Valuation Compared to Industry Peers

**Market Valuation Discrepancy**

* **Underappreciated Value**: Despite securing a landmark contract and demonstrating significant growth potential, Red Cat's market valuation remains lower than private peers like Skydio, Anduril Industries, and Shield AI.

**Revenue Multiples**

* **Industry Comparison**: Competitors are trading at revenue multiples ranging from **18× to 28×**. For instance:
   * **Shield AI**: Trading at **18.4×** revenue.
   * **Anduril Industries**: Trading at **28×** revenue.
   * **Skydio**: Recent valuation at **$2.2 billion**, trading at **22×** revenue.
* **Red Cat's Multiple**: Based on the company's guidance, Red Cat trades at a significantly lower multiple, suggesting substantial upside potential when aligning with industry standards.

**Upside Potential**

* **Implied Valuation**: Using projected revenues of **$100 million** and applying a conservative industry revenue multiple of **20×**, Red Cat's implied market capitalization could be **$2 billion**.
* **Implied Stock Price**: With approximately **75.5 million** shares outstanding, this valuation translates to an implied stock price of approximately **$26.49** per share.
* **Potential Upside**: This represents an approximate **182% increase** from the current stock price of **$9.39**.

# 4. Strategic Capital Management

**No Immediate Capital Raise**

* **Financial Flexibility**: The company has filed a **$100 million mixed securities shelf registration**, allowing Red Cat to issue various types of securities over time. However, management has indicated **no immediate plans** to raise capital through equity offerings.
* **Utilizing Debt Instruments**: Red Cat has room on its existing debt instrument and may use this for short-term capital needs, minimizing shareholder dilution.

**Minimal Capital Raise if Needed**

* **Operational Continuity**: Any potential capital raise would be around **$10-15 million** to ensure operational efficiency without significant dilution.

**Investor Assurance**

* **Fiscal Responsibility**: CEO Jeff Thompson emphasizes a prudent approach to capital management, focusing on maximizing shareholder value and achieving cash-flow-positive operations.

# 5. Product Development and Expansion Opportunities

**Advanced Drone Focus**

* **Teal's Black Widow Drone**
   * **Technological Advancements**: The **Black Widow** is a **3-pound**, folding, backpack-size drone capable of flying autonomously without GPS, using an internal map for navigation.
   * **Electronic Warfare Resilience**: It can operate without emitting radio frequencies for up to **40 minutes**, making it less susceptible to detection and jamming—a critical advantage in modern warfare.
   * **Features**: Rugged, reliable, fully modular, quiet, long flight time and range, high-resolution cameras, stealth modes, onboard compute for AI and autonomy, capability to carry secondary payloads, and operation in electronic warfare environments.
* **Webb Controller**
   * **Innovative Design**: Teal designed the **Webb** controller from scratch in less than five months. It is now the **program of record controller** for SRR.
   * **User-Centric Features**: Easy to use, comfortable to hold, modular, supports RF silent and stealth modes, uses the same battery as the drone, simplifying logistics.
* **Manufacturing Capabilities**
   * **High-Volume Production**: Teal has designed the Black Widow and Webb for **mass production**, with the capacity to produce **hundreds of systems per month** in low-rate initial production (LRIP) and scaling to **thousands per month** by the end of next year.
   * **Scalability**: The manufacturing facility can increase output by adding shifts, including moving to two or three shifts and operating on weekends.

**Edge 130 Drone**

* **FlightWave Acquisition**: Red Cat's acquisition of FlightWave adds the **Edge 130** drone to its portfolio.
* **Order Backlog**: Over **200 orders** for the Edge 130, expected to be delivered in Q1.
* **New Facility**: The company is moving into a new factory to accommodate production needs.

**Mass Deployment Readiness**

* **Scalability**: Red Cat's drones are well-suited for large-scale deployment initiatives like the Replicator program and can meet the high demand seen in conflicts such as Ukraine.
* **Red Cat Futures Initiative**
   * **R&D Focus**: The company is pursuing research and development opportunities to integrate capabilities with strategic partners, enhancing their product offerings and addressing future mission needs.
   * **Software Ecosystem**: Plans to offer a menu of configurations and software applications for different use cases, leveraging the onboard compute power for AI and autonomy.

# 6. Increased Industry Recognition

**Media Coverage**

* **National Attention**: Red Cat and Teal Drones have received significant attention from major outlets, including features in **The Wall Street Journal**, highlighting their strategic importance and technological advancements.

**Investor Interest**

* **Market Visibility**: Heightened visibility is attracting major investment banks and potential investors, increasing the company's profile within the investment community.

**Blue UAS Listing**

* **DIU Blue UAS Refresh Challenge**: Red Cat has submitted the Black Widow and Edge 130 drones for inclusion in the Department of Defense's Blue UAS list.
* **Progress**: Both drones have passed initial testing phases and are moving into the final stage, involving review of bill of materials and cybersecurity practices.

# 7. Competitive Landscape and Industry Challenges

**Competitor Challenges**

* **Skydio's Setbacks**
   * **Operational Failures**: Skydio's drones underperformed in Ukraine, suffering from electronic warfare tactics that led to loss of control and drones going off course.
   * **Loss of SRR Contract**: Skydio lost out to Teal Drones in the SRR program, despite significant venture capital backing.
* **Other Competitors**
   * **AeroVironment's Switchblade Drones**: Faced difficulties due to Russian jamming and GPS blackouts, impacting their reliability.
   * **Cyberlux's Production Issues**: Failed to meet production and delivery goals, affecting credibility.

**Red Cat's Competitive Edge**

* **Technological Superiority**: Red Cat's drones are designed to withstand electronic warfare, operate without GPS, and meet the rigorous requirements of modern battlefields.
* **Mission-Driven Approach**: The company's focus on building drones specifically to meet the Army's needs contributed to winning the SRR contract.
* **Manufacturing Readiness**: Red Cat's ability to mass-produce drones efficiently positions it favorably against competitors who may struggle with production scaling.

# 8. Strategic Partnerships and Government Relations

**Advocacy and Policy Support**

* **Government Engagement**: Red Cat is actively working with the Department of Defense and Congress to ensure funding and support for expanding the SRR program.
* **NDAA Funding**: The National Defense Authorization Act includes approximately **$79.5 million** for the SRR program line, with efforts to increase appropriations in future fiscal years.

**International Opportunities**

* **NATO Allies**: Multiple NATO countries are showing strong interest in adopting the Black Widow drone, with some potential contracts larger than the SRR program.
* **Asia-Pacific Expansion**: Engagement with countries like Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, the Philippines, and South Korea opens additional markets.

# 9. Management and Leadership

**Experienced Team**

* **CEO Jeff Thompson**: Emphasizes fiscal responsibility, strategic growth, and maximizing shareholder value.
* **George Matus**: Founder of Teal Drones, instrumental in designing the Black Widow and Webb controller, focused on meeting Army requirements and soldier feedback.
* **Geoff Hitchcock**: Brings decades of experience from previous roles at AeroVironment, contributing to securing programs of record and international expansion.

**Board of Directors**

* **General Paul Funk II**: Recently joined the board, providing valuable insights from his military experience, emphasizing the importance of kinetic capabilities and battlefield needs.

**Stock Price Potential Based on Updated Calculations**

* **Current Market Capitalization**: Approximately **$480 million** (reflecting recent stock performance).
* **Current Stock Price**: **$9.39** (as per the latest data).
* **Shares Outstanding**: Approximately **75.5 million**.
* **Projected Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue**: **$100 million** (potentially higher with additional appropriations and contracts).
* **Industry Revenue Multiple**: **20×** annual revenue.

**Implied Valuation**

* **Implied Market Capitalization**: $100 million × 20 = **$2 billion**.
* **Implied Stock Price**: $2 billion / 75.5 million shares = Approximately **$26.49** per share.

**Potential Upside**

* **Percentage Increase**: (($26.49 - $9.39) / $9.39) × 100% = Approximately **182% increase**.

**Considerations and Assumptions**

* **Revenue Achievement**: The company successfully achieves the projected revenues through the execution of the SRR contract and potential additional contracts with other military branches, government agencies, and international customers.
* **Market Valuation Alignment**: The market values Red Cat at a 20× revenue multiple, consistent with industry peers.
* **Technological Leadership**: Red Cat continues to innovate and maintain its technological edge over competitors.
* **Production Scaling**: The company effectively scales production to meet demand, maintaining quality and efficiency.

**Conclusion**

Red Cat Holdings appears to be undervalued relative to its industry peers. With a significant U.S. Army contract, anticipated growth, and involvement in key defense initiatives, the company is strategically positioned for potential expansion. The high demand for reliable drones in modern conflicts, combined with competitors' shortcomings, amplifies Red Cat's market opportunity. The company's mission-driven approach, technological advancements, and manufacturing readiness provide a strong foundation for growth.

Investors should consider these factors while also conducting their own due diligence. The discrepancy between Red Cat's current market valuation and that of its peers suggests substantial upside potential.

Red Cat Holdings, Inc. is a technology company specializing in the development of drone systems and solutions for military and commercial applications. In response to the United States renewing bans on DJI drones through legislation such as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and the American Security Drone Act, Red Cat focuses on providing advanced, domestically produced unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and related technologies. The company's products aim to enhance drone operations while addressing national security concerns by supplying secure, American-made drone solutions. Through its subsidiaries, including **Teal Drones** and **FlightWave**, Red Cat offers products that support reconnaissance, surveillance, and other critical functions, delivering innovative solutions to defense organizations and industries requiring drone capabilities[.](https://imgur.com/a/8E9PtMl)

**Investment Thesis**

Jeff Thompson, CEO of Red Cat Holdings, has outlined significant developments that position the company for substantial growth and potential undervaluation in the market. The following points highlight the company's strategic advantages and growth prospects, incorporating recent developments from the company's earnings call and industry dynamics.

# 1. Significant U.S. Army Contract

**SRR Program Win**

* **Contract Award**: Red Cat's subsidiary, **Teal Drones**, has been selected as the sole winner of the U.S. Army's **Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) program**, securing a contract to deliver **5,880 systems**. Each system includes **two drones and one controller**, amounting to a total of **11,760 drones**.
* **Contract Value**: The average price of a system is around **$45,000**, depending on configuration. This implies a base contract value of approximately **$264 million**.
* **Competitive Edge**: Teal Drones was chosen over better-funded competitors like Skydio, which has raised over **$700 million** in venture capital. Despite being an underdog, Teal's technological advancements and ability to meet the Army's stringent requirements led to this significant win.

**Additional Revenue Streams**

* **Maintenance and Support**: The contract includes provisions for repairs, training, and spare parts, which could increase the contract's value by an additional **50-70%**. Historically, programs of record have seen significant revenue from spares and support over many years.
* **Expansion Potential**: The SRR program's success positions Red Cat to secure additional contracts with other military branches, U.S. government agencies, and NATO allies.

**Program of Record Status**

* **Simplified Procurement**: Achieving **Program of Record** status streamlines the procurement process for other defense organizations, allowing them to purchase directly off the SRR contract. This designation enhances credibility and accelerates additional orders and long-term partnerships.

# 2. Anticipated Growth and Revenue Projections

**Projected Revenues**

* **Fiscal Year Projections**: The company has provided guidance of **$50-55 million** for calendar year 2025, based on the initial phases of the SRR contract.
* **Potential Upside**: With additional appropriations and the possibility of accelerated procurement, revenues could increase significantly. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes approximately **$79.5 million** in funding for the program line that supports SRR.
* **Long-Term Outlook**: Including potential additional contracts and support services, annual revenues could reach around **$100 million**, excluding new contracts.

**Future Contracts**

* **International Demand**: NATO allies and other international partners have shown strong interest in the Black Widow drone, especially after the SRR program win. Some opportunities may eclipse the SRR program in size and value.
* **Expansion into Asia-Pacific**: The company is also engaging with Asian allies, such as Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, the Philippines, and South Korea, to explore additional sales opportunities.
* **Replicator Initiative Participation**: Red Cat is involved in the Department of Defense's **Replicator program** to mass-produce affordable, autonomous drones, potentially leading to larger future contracts.

# 3. Valuation Compared to Industry Peers

**Market Valuation Discrepancy**

* **Underappreciated Value**: Despite securing a landmark contract and demonstrating significant growth potential, Red Cat's market valuation remains lower than private peers like Skydio, Anduril Industries, and Shield AI.

**Revenue Multiples**

* **Industry Comparison**: Competitors are trading at revenue multiples ranging from **18× to 28×**. For instance:
   * **Shield AI**: Trading at **18.4×** revenue.
   * **Anduril Industries**: Trading at **28×** revenue.
   * **Skydio**: Recent valuation at **$2.2 billion**, trading at **22×** revenue.
* **Red Cat's Multiple**: Based on the company's guidance, Red Cat trades at a significantly lower multiple, suggesting substantial upside potential when aligning with industry standards.

**Upside Potential**

* **Implied Valuation**: Using projected revenues of **$100 million** and applying a conservative industry revenue multiple of **20×**, Red Cat's implied market capitalization could be **$2 billion**.
* **Implied Stock Price**: With approximately **75.5 million** shares outstanding, this valuation translates to an implied stock price of approximately **$26.49** per share.
* **Potential Upside**: This represents an approximate **182% increase** from the current stock price of **$9.39**.

# 4. Strategic Capital Management

**No Immediate Capital Raise**

* **Financial Flexibility**: The company has filed a **$100 million mixed securities shelf registration**, allowing Red Cat to issue various types of securities over time. However, management has indicated **no immediate plans** to raise capital through equity offerings.
* **Utilizing Debt Instruments**: Red Cat has room on its existing debt instrument and may use this for short-term capital needs, minimizing shareholder dilution.

**Minimal Capital Raise if Needed**

* **Operational Continuity**: Any potential capital raise would be around **$10-15 million** to ensure operational efficiency without significant dilution.

**Investor Assurance**

* **Fiscal Responsibility**: CEO Jeff Thompson emphasizes a prudent approach to capital management, focusing on maximizing shareholder value and achieving cash-flow-positive operations.

# 5. Product Development and Expansion Opportunities

**Advanced Drone Focus**

* **Teal's Black Widow Drone**
   * **Technological Advancements**: The **Black Widow** is a **3-pound**, folding, backpack-size drone capable of flying autonomously without GPS, using an internal map for navigation.
   * **Electronic Warfare Resilience**: It can operate without emitting radio frequencies for up to **40 minutes**, making it less susceptible to detection and jamming—a critical advantage in modern warfare.
   * **Features**: Rugged, reliable, fully modular, quiet, long flight time and range, high-resolution cameras, stealth modes, onboard compute for AI and autonomy, capability to carry secondary payloads, and operation in electronic warfare environments.
* **Webb Controller**
   * **Innovative Design**: Teal designed the **Webb** controller from scratch in less than five months. It is now the **program of record controller** for SRR.
   * **User-Centric Features**: Easy to use, comfortable to hold, modular, supports RF silent and stealth modes, uses the same battery as the drone, simplifying logistics.
* **Manufacturing Capabilities**
   * **High-Volume Production**: Teal has designed the Black Widow and Webb for **mass production**, with the capacity to produce **hundreds of systems per month** in low-rate initial production (LRIP) and scaling to **thousands per month** by the end of next year.
   * **Scalability**: The manufacturing facility can increase output by adding shifts, including moving to two or three shifts and operating on weekends.

**Edge 130 Drone**

* **FlightWave Acquisition**: Red Cat's acquisition of FlightWave adds the **Edge 130** drone to its portfolio.
* **Order Backlog**: Over **200 orders** for the Edge 130, expected to be delivered in Q1.
* **New Facility**: The company is moving into a new factory to accommodate production needs.

**Mass Deployment Readiness**

* **Scalability**: Red Cat's drones are well-suited for large-scale deployment initiatives like the Replicator program and can meet the high demand seen in conflicts such as Ukraine.

* **Progress**: Both drones have passed initial testing phases and are moving into the final stage, involving review of bill of materials and cybersecurity practices.

# 7. Competitive Landscape and Industry Challenges

**Competitor Challenges**

* **Skydio's Setbacks**
   * **Operational Failures**: Skydio's drones underperformed in Ukraine, suffering from electronic warfare tactics that led to loss of control and drones going off course.
   * **Loss of SRR Contract**: Skydio lost out to Teal Drones in the SRR program, despite significant venture capital backing.
* **Other Competitors**
   * **AeroVironment's Switchblade Drones**: Faced difficulties due to Russian jamming and GPS blackouts, impacting their reliability.
   * **Cyberlux's Production Issues**: Failed to meet production and delivery goals, affecting credibility.

**Red Cat's Competitive Edge**

* **Technological Superiority**: Red Cat's drones are designed to withstand electronic warfare, operate without GPS, and meet the rigorous requirements of modern battlefields.
* **Mission-Driven Approach**: The company's focus on building drones specifically to meet the Army's needs contributed to winning the SRR contract.
* **Manufacturing Readiness**: Red Cat's ability to mass-produce drones efficiently positions it favorably against competitors who may struggle with production scaling.

# 8. Strategic Partnerships and Government Relations

**Advocacy and Policy Support**

* **Government Engagement**: Red Cat is actively working with the Department of Defense and Congress to ensure funding and support for expanding the SRR program.
* **NDAA Funding**: The National Defense Authorization Act includes approximately **$79.5 million** for the SRR program line, with efforts to increase appropriations in future fiscal years.

**International Opportunities**

* **NATO Allies**: Multiple NATO countries are showing strong interest in adopting the Black Widow drone, with some potential contracts larger than the SRR program.
* **Asia-Pacific Expansion**: Engagement with countries like Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, the Philippines, and South Korea opens additional markets.

* **George Matus**: Founder of Teal Drones, instrumental in designing the Black Widow and Webb controller, focused on meeting Army requirements and soldier feedback.
* **Geoff Hitchcock**: Brings decades of experience from previous roles at AeroVironment, contributing to securing programs of record and international expansion.

**Board of Directors**

* **General Paul Funk II**: Recently joined the board, providing valuable insights from his military experience, emphasizing the importance of kinetic capabilities and battlefield needs.

**Stock Price Potential Based on Updated Calculations**

* **Current Market Capitalization**: Approximately **$480 million** (reflecting recent stock performance).
* **Current Stock Price**: **$9.39** (as per the latest data).
* **Shares Outstanding**: Approximately **75.5 million**.
* **Projected Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue**: **$100 million** (potentially higher with additional appropriations and contracts).
* **Industry Revenue Multiple**: **20×** annual revenue.

**Implied Valuation**

* **Implied Market Capitalization**: $100 million × 20 = **$2 billion**.
* **Implied Stock Price**: $2 billion / 75.5 million shares = Approximately **$26.49** per share.

**Potential Upside**

* **Percentage Increase**: (($26.49 - $9.39) / $9.39) × 100% = Approximately **182% increase**.

**Considerations and Assumptions**

* **Revenue Achievement**: The company successfully achieves the projected revenues through the execution of the SRR contract and potential additional contracts with other military branches, government agencies, and international customers.
* **Market Valuation Alignment**: The market values Red Cat at a 20× revenue multiple, consistent with industry peers.
* **Technological Leadership**: Red Cat continues to innovate and maintain its technological edge over competitors.
* **Production Scaling**: The company effectively scales production to meet demand, maintaining quality and efficiency.

**Conclusion**

Red Cat Holdings appears to be undervalued relative to its industry peers. With a significant U.S. Army contract, anticipated growth, and involvement in key defense initiatives, the company is strategically positioned for potential expansion. The high demand for reliable drones in modern conflicts, combined with competitors' shortcomings, amplifies Red Cat's market opportunity. The company's mission-driven approach, technological advancements, and manufacturing readiness provide a strong foundation for growth.

Investors should consider these factors while also conducting their own due diligence. The discrepancy between Red Cat's current market valuation and that of its peers suggests substantial upside potential.

Alright, fellow degenerates, hear me out. I think (Kohls) KSS is an absolute gem right now, sitting at $15. Here's the case:

1. Franchise Group tried to buy KSS at $69 per share in April 2022 💸Yeah, you read that right. Franchise Group was willing to pay $69 for Kohl's not even two years ago. The deal was rejected (major facepalm move on Kohl's part), but it gives us a benchmark for what the market thought KSS was worth. Now, let’s take a moment to think about why Franchise Group was willing to pay that much... This wasn't some random offer. Kohls has value. It's just undervalued right now.

2. Oak Street Real Estate Deal – A $2B Real Estate Portfolio 🏢After that rejection, Oak Street stepped in and made an offer to buy a portion of Kohl's real estate for $2B. Wait—$2 billion for a portion of the real estate? At the current market cap of $1.65 billion, that tells you one thing: Kohl's real estate alone is worth more than the ENTIRE company. If we’re being conservative, the real estate portfolio could easily be worth $4-5 billion, which is well above where the stock is trading right now. So, the company’s assets are massively underpriced.

3. 32% Short Interest – Don’t need to tell you guys about potential, you know the drill.

4. Seasonal Play – December to January Pop Historically, Kohl’s stock tends to do well in the December to January timeframe, often gaining around 25-30%. Worst-case scenario, you’re breaking even based on the past 5 years if you’re holding through this period, but with the setup here, I’d bet on a solid upside. Buy in December, sell in January, rinse and repeat.

TL;DR

\* Franchise Group offered $69 for Kohl's in 2022. The stock is $15 today.

\* Oak Street valued Kohl's real estate at $2B for a portion. That’s a huge asset undervaluation.

\* 32% short interest

\* December to January historically sees a 30% upside.

So, what’s the risk at $15? This stock is undervalued and has additional catalysts.

This isn’t financial advice, but this setup has ""degenerate gains"" written all over it. 🤘

Apollo tried to buy Kohls in 2022 for 8B (nothing has changed drastically about its business between now and then). 

Let’s break down Kohl’s ($KSS). The stock is down 20% today, trading at an all-time low with a market cap under $2 billion. Meanwhile, the company generates $600 million in free cash flow (FCF) annually and owns $7 billion in real estate assets. with net assets of $4B. 

1.The Business: Kohl’s still did $18 billion in sales for fiscal 2024, even without fully capitalizing on its Sephora partnership, which is boosting foot traffic in every store its been rolled out in (and they continue to roll out more) .

2. Valuation and Cash Flow:
	•	Kohl’s generated $300 million in net income last fiscal year and nearly double that in free cash flow (FCF): $600 million. Based on this quarter they’ll likely land somewhere in a similar ball park.
	•	Historically, Kohl’s has averaged $1 billion in FCF, meaning current results are already deeply discounted. And yet, the stock is trading at just 3x FCF.
	•	The discrepancy between net income and FCF comes from non-cash expenses like depreciation on their $7 billion real estate portfolio. This isn’t “money burned”—it’s accounting noise.

3. Balance Sheet Strength:
	•	Kohl’s has $14 billion in total assets/4B net, with a large portion being real estate. They own over 400 stores outright—hard assets that could generate significant cash in a liquidation scenario.
	•	Liabilities are about 11B, Yes, they exist, but Kohl’s is far from distressed, with manageable debt relative to their assets and FCF generation.

4. Short Interest:
	•	Over 30% of Kohl’s shares are shorted. Shorts betting on total collapse might not fully understand the cash generation and real estate value here. Any positive catalyst—a strategic pivot, real estate monetization, or improved retail sentiment. 

5. CEO Departure:
	•	Kohl’s just announced its CEO, Tom Kingsbury, is stepping down—news that likely contributed to today’s selloff. But here’s the kicker: Kingsbury was adamant about NOT selling Kohl’s assets. His departure reopens the possibility of a real estate monetization play, which could unlock billions in value.

	•	Remember: Kohl’s rejected an $8 billion buyout offer from Apollo Global Management in 2022. That was four times today’s valuation.
The Bottom Line:
For a $2 billion market cap, you’re buying:
	•	$7 billion in real estate assets (including 400+ owned stores).
	•	$600 million annual FCF, even in a “bad” year.
	•	A company that generates enough cash to pay an 11% dividend yield.

If you told me I could buy $7 billion in hard assets (4B net of liabilities) and $600 million in annual cash flow for under $2 billion, I’d say yes every time. That’s Kohl’s today.
This isn’t a growth story—it’s a cash-and-assets story. You’re betting that the business, even if it declines slowly, will return far more than its current valuation. Or that someone with deep pockets will take notice and bid. Either way, this valuation is ridiculous.

	•	Kohl’s has $14 billion in total assets/4B net, with a large portion being real estate. They own over 400 stores outright—hard assets that could generate significant cash in a liquidation scenario.
	•	Liabilities are about 11B, Yes, they exist, but Kohl’s is far from distressed, with manageable debt relative to their assets and FCF generation.
4. Short Interest:
	•	Over 30% of Kohl’s shares are shorted. Shorts betting on total collapse might not fully understand the cash generation and real estate value here. Any positive catalyst—a strategic pivot, real estate monetization, or improved retail sentiment…
5. CEO Departure:
	•	Kohl’s just announced its CEO, Tom Kingsbury, is stepping down—news that likely contributed to today’s selloff. But here’s the kicker: Kingsbury was adamant about NOT selling Kohl’s assets. His departure reopens the possibility of a real estate monetization play, which could unlock billions in value.
	•	Remember: Kohl’s rejected an $8 billion buyout offer from Apollo Global Management in 2022. That was four times today’s valuation.
The Bottom Line:
For a $2 billion market cap, you’re buying:
	•	$7 billion in real estate assets (including 400+ owned stores).
	•	$600 million annual FCF, even in a “bad” year.
	•	A company that generates enough cash to pay an 11% dividend yield.
If you told me I could buy $7 billion in hard assets (4B net of liabilities) and $600 million in annual cash flow for under $2 billion, I’d say yes every time. That’s Kohl’s today.
This isn’t a growth story—it’s a cash-and-assets story. You’re betting that the business, even if it declines slowly, will return far more than its current valuation. Or that someone with deep pockets will take notice and bid. Either way, this valuation is ridiculous.
Shorts, good luck.","Apollo tried to buy Kohls in 2022 for 8B (nothing has changed drastically about its business between now and then). 
Let’s break down Kohl’s ($KSS). The stock is down 20% today, trading at an all-time low with a market cap under $2 billion. Meanwhile, the company generates $600 million in free cash flow (FCF) annually and owns $7 billion in real estate assets. with net assets of $4B. 
1.The Business: Kohl’s still did $18 billion in sales for fiscal 2024, even without fully capitalizing on its Sephora partnership, which is boosting foot traffic in every store its been rolled out in (and they continue to roll out more) .
2. Valuation and Cash Flow:
	•	Kohl’s generated $300 million in net income last fiscal year and nearly double that in free cash flow (FCF): $600 million. Based on this quarter they’ll likely land somewhere in a similar ball park.
	•	Historically, Kohl’s has averaged $1 billion in FCF, meaning current results are already deeply discounted. And yet, the stock is trading at just 3x FCF.
	•	The discrepancy between net income and FCF comes from non-cash expenses like depreciation on their $7 billion real estate portfolio. This isn’t “money burned”—it’s accounting noise.

	•	Kohl’s has $14 billion in total assets/4B net, with a large portion being real estate. They own over 400 stores outright—hard assets that could generate significant cash in a liquidation scenario.

Stock Trading near All-Time Lows at a Sub-$2B Market Cap, $600M FCF, $4B in Assets, and Over 30% Short Interest - Absurd.
Yesterday’s post about Kohl’s sparked a ton of discussion, so I wanted to address some of the recurring comments and clarify a few things. Here's the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h0dgpq/stock\_is\_trading\_at\_alltime\_lows\_with\_a\_sub2b/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h0dgpq/stock_is_trading_at_alltime_lows_with_a_sub2b/)  
  
Let’s dive in:

1. I Quintupled Down: Throughout the day, I added to my position every time I read a bearish comment that ignored the three core pillars of the thesis: Kohl’s cash position, net asset value, and dividend yield. **As of now, I’m $130K deep into this trade. I’m not just holding—I’m convicted.**

2. This Is NOT About Growth: Kohl’s isn’t suddenly going to become the next Amazon, and that’s fine. The thesis isn’t predicated on some retail turnaround miracle. This is a simple value play: I’m buying $2 worth of assets for $1. Kohl’s NAV dwarfs its market cap, and it throws off real cash flow.

3. On Being Called a Hedge Fund Employee: Here’s a non-exhaustive list of funds shorting Kohl’s—most of them levered to the hilt on the trade. They are the reason this opportunity exists, and they’re going to learn the hard way what happens when you short cash-generative, asset-rich businesses into being deeply overly-sold. The current market cap is \~1.6B, thats going to be hard to cover. Hedge funds are the competition on this trade. Im not a particularly adversarial person. Except when it comes to hedge funds, they in particular are the number 1 public competition.

4. Bag Holding vs. Conviction: There are times when you feel like a bag holder and hopium is your drug. And then there are times where when it goes down you calmly buy more. And in the latter times, you want to bring everyone along for the ride. Because getting rich alone isn’t meaningful. Making your friends rich, that’s what life is about.

Stay tuned—this is just getting started.

2. This is a pure value play: Kohl’s isn’t suddenly going to become the next Amazon, and that’s fine. The thesis isn’t predicated on some retail turnaround miracle. This is a simple value play: I’m buying $2 worth of assets for $1. Kohl’s NAV dwarfs its market cap, and it throws off real cash flow.
3. New CEO: the markets reaction (and many of the comments) was that the new CEO is a bearish signal, makes no sense. The new CEO is the guy who turned around Michaels in 2020 and SOLD IT TO APOLLO FOR $3B. The worst thing about Kohls management thus far has been their desire to not liquidate its most valuable asset (real estate) and instead simply return cash flow to shareholders. I’m not complaining about the latter, but the former would’ve been an $8B sale in 2022 if management had agreed to it. Currently trading for $1.5B with the same real estate assets on the book.

At your age, you can be tolerate more risk. On my youtube channel, i shared that i like a distribution of 30% high risk, 30% low to mid risk, 40% retirement. High risk doesnt have to be all crypto, nor would i recommend it to be all 30%, maybe 10-15% tops. I personally have 3-5% in crypto.

This works for a couple reasons:

1. The retirement portion you’ll hopefully benefit from employer matching programs. You can also maximize cotributing to a ROTH so your gains can grow TAX FREE once you retire

2. Your high risk contributions, if they tank, it’s okay cause your so young! And in the case it pays out, you’ll have great ROI.

2024-11-27,KO,investing,post,1h1avzc,,,Self-Employed Retirement and Tax Strategies: Where Should I Start?,"Self-Employed Retirement and Tax Strategies: Where Should I Start?
Hi everyone,

I've been diving into way too many YouTube videos a lot of (Mark J. Kohler’s channel) about where to start putting retirement funds as a self-employed individual, with an overload of information I don't know if I'm any further with my knowledge. 

Here’s my situation:

* I just turned 34 and have been running my own business for six years.
* For the first five years, I made heavy equipment purchases that provided significant tax deductions, leaving little room to contribute to retirement. Excess cash was reinvested into scaling the business.
* In 2024, I no longer have those large write-offs and don’t foresee major purchases for a while. As a result, my tax bill is projected to be $35-40k this year.
* I roughly have $40K today that I would put toward retirement. 

# Steps I’ve Looked Into So Far:

1. **HSA (Health Savings Account):**
   * I wish I’d started this sooner.
   * I currently have a marketplace PPO plan but wanted to switch to a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) for December to use the “last month rule” and make a 2024 HSA contribution. Unfortunately, I learned this requires a qualifying life event to change plans outside open enrollment, so my HDHP won’t begin until January 2025.
   * I plan to max out the $4,300 contribution for 2025, but this won’t help reduce my 2024 tax burden.
2. **Solo 401(k):**
   * This seems like a logical next step to reduce taxes and begin building retirement savings.

# Additional Notes:

* I haven’t set up an S-corp yet. The main reason is that I’m planning to build a garage-house in 2026 and want to avoid complicating my tax returns for loan qualification. Once the loan is secured, I’ll likely switch to an S-corp.

# My Questions for You:

1. What would you prioritize to maximize tax savings and begin retirement funding for 2024?
2. Are there other strategies or accounts (besides an HSA and Solo 401(k)) that I should be considering?

Thanks in advance for your help!","Hi everyone,

Seems like an extremely degenerate opportunity here. You have business in unambiguous secular decline. They *were* doing like $1B in FCF a year recently, but now it is eaten up by gigantic capex ($500M a year) to put in Sephora stores inside their locations. Not sure how long that is intended to last. Inventory is looking okay, down 3% YoY, despite sales decline.

Long term debt has gone from $2.8B in 2017 to $1.5B expected by end of Q4. They reduced it by $113M earlier this year. [The debt maturity schedule gives them a lot of time](https://i.imgur.com/Y1uZdGQ.png). They're still paying $220M annually in a dividend that they can cut if needed. Share count is 1/3 what it was pre-GFC (it's been a long long decline). But clearly that was awful timing looking at the business crash and burn.

So it seems like they can escape bankruptcy. Somehow can afford $500M in capex while repaying debt + 13.5% div yield. Need to clear out the entire management/board, anyone who opposed the Apollo offer at more than 4x the current market cap.

What was Apollo thinking??? Clearly they saw *some* value in KSS assets. So maybe there is some asymmetric play here.

Moreover, I'm expecting strong YoY growth in [KCF (Kohl's Cash Flow)](https://i.imgur.com/5VT8L8k.jpeg)...","Crazy that Kohl's ($KSS) turned down a $9B buyout offer from Apollo to go private and is today worth $1.6B.

2024-11-27,KO,wallstreetbets,post,1h12aix,,,PayPal: A Path Back to Its Historical Strength and Growth Potential ,"PayPal: A Path Back to Its Historical Strength and Growth Potential 

PayPal, once a darling of the fintech space, has seen its valuation contract significantly over the past few years. With its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently hovering around 20, the stock is far below its historical average of 43. A return to that average, driven by projected earnings of $5.71 per share by 2025, would imply a stock price north of $246—an opportunity that many investors might be overlooking. But for PayPal to reclaim its historical valuation, much must fall into place.

The foundation of PayPal’s future lies in its strategic initiatives, beginning with the integration of its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD). Introduced in 2023, PYUSD is more than just another digital currency; it is PayPal’s bridge to the future of blockchain-powered commerce. Unlike many failed stablecoin experiments, PYUSD is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits and Treasuries, giving it the stability and trustworthiness needed to thrive. The potential for PYUSD to facilitate global cross-border payments and power decentralized finance (DeFi) applications is immense. PayPal’s ability to capitalize on this innovation could redefine its relevance in the financial ecosystem.

Beyond cryptocurrency, PayPal is making waves with a growing advertising business that has largely flown under the radar. By leveraging its immense trove of transactional data from over 400 million active users, the company is building a platform that allows merchants to create highly targeted and effective marketing campaigns. This advertising arm, though still in its early stages, has the potential to generate billions in annual revenue. Even modest success here could have a significant impact on PayPal’s top line, creating another compelling growth driver.

Innovation has always been at the heart of PayPal’s strategy, and recent developments like the Fastlane checkout system showcase its commitment to staying ahead. This one-click guest checkout feature, paired with partnerships with major platforms like Shopify and Fiserv, enhances the company’s offerings for merchants and consumers alike. Meanwhile, initiatives like the CashPass rewards program deepen user engagement and loyalty, ensuring that PayPal remains a go-to solution for everyday transactions.

Leadership will play a critical role in PayPal’s resurgence, and newly appointed CEO Alex Chriss appears well-suited for the task. With a proven track record at Intuit, Chriss has demonstrated his ability to foster innovation and deliver results. His focus on empowering small businesses aligns perfectly with PayPal’s strengths and provides a roadmap for future growth.

But the journey back to a P/E of 43 will require more than just strategic initiatives and innovation. PayPal needs to rebuild investor confidence. The company must consistently deliver strong earnings, improve operational efficiencies, and effectively communicate its vision to the market. Transparent updates on key growth areas—such as PYUSD adoption, advertising revenue, and merchant partnerships—will be crucial in shaping the market’s perception of PayPal’s potential.

A return to PayPal’s historical valuation isn’t just about numbers; it’s about the story the company tells and the trust it rebuilds with investors. If PayPal can execute on its strategy, the potential reward is not just a higher stock price but a reaffirmation of its position as a leader in the fintech space. For those willing to look beyond the current market sentiment, PayPal’s path to $246 offers a compelling narrative of transformation, growth, and untapped opportunity.

TL;DR: PayPal is undervalued at a P/E of 20 compared to its historical average of 43. To return to its peak valuation, it must capitalize on its stablecoin (PYUSD), grow its new advertising business, and leverage innovative products like Fastlane Checkout. Under CEO Alex Chriss, with strategic execution and strong earnings, PayPal could see a stock price of $246 by 2025, reaffirming its leadership in fintech.

Reddit, the American online discussion platform, has overtaken X to become the fifth most popular social media platform in the UK, according to the communications watchdog.

Ofcom said Reddit, where users post on discussion threads within topic-based communities, was visited by 22.9 million UK adults in May this year, compared with 22.1 million on X.

The figures make Reddit the fastest-growing large social media platform in the UK and represent a growth of 47% on the same period in 2023. The leap took Reddit above LinkedIn and X into fifth place on the table of UK social media platforms, which is now topped by YouTube after it overtook [Facebook](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook), reaching more than 44 million adults.

Reddit, renowned for its devoted user base who refer to one another as Redditors, appears to have been boosted by updates to Google’s search engine this year.

Farhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, said: “Google’s latest algorithm update in the first half of 2024 gave Reddit a big boost in organic search traffic. I think that has probably contributed a lot.”

Ofcom also speculated that the change may have been caused [by alterations to how third-party apps accessed its content](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/14/reddit-moderators-vow-to-continue-blackout-in-api-access-fees-row), forcing users of those apps to switch to the Reddit site. The watchdog also flagged publicity around Reddit’s stock market flotation in March this year.

The popularity of X also fell over the same period, according to Ofcom, with its reach falling by 8% since May last year. X has been criticised over content moderation standards since its [takeover by Elon Musk in 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal) but it has also faced competition since July 2023 from Threads, a rival to X [launched by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/06/meta-launches-twitter-rival-threads-in-100-countries).

The Ofcom figures featured in the watchdog’s annual report into the nation’s digital habits, which revealed that four out of 10 UK adults say they have encountered misinformation or deepfakes, with the majority of those cases occurring online.

The misinformation survey, based on a poll of more than 4,000 UK adults, also found that three in 10 adults believe there is a single group of people who control the world together, with the same number believing there is “significant evidence” of electoral fraud in the UK.

The regulator also found that one-third of UK adults are not confident in judging whether an image or a piece of audio or video has been created by artificial intelligence.","[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk)

2024-11-28,KO,stocks,post,1h1tt6z,,,PayPal: A Path Back to Its Historical Strength and Growth Potential,"PayPal: A Path Back to Its Historical Strength and Growth Potential
PayPal, once a darling of the fintech space, has seen its valuation contract significantly over the past few years. With its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently hovering around 20, the stock is far below its historical average of 43. A return to that average, driven by projected earnings of $5.71 per share by 2025, would imply a stock price north of $246—an opportunity that many investors might be overlooking. But for PayPal to reclaim its historical valuation, much must fall into place.

The foundation of PayPal’s future lies in its strategic initiatives, beginning with the integration of its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD). Introduced in 2023, PYUSD is more than just another digital currency; it is PayPal’s bridge to the future of blockchain-powered commerce. Unlike many failed stablecoin experiments, PYUSD is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits and Treasuries, giving it the stability and trustworthiness needed to thrive. The potential for PYUSD to facilitate global cross-border payments and power decentralized finance (DeFi) applications is immense. PayPal’s ability to capitalize on this innovation could redefine its relevance in the financial ecosystem.

Beyond cryptocurrency, PayPal is making waves with a growing advertising business that has largely flown under the radar. By leveraging its immense trove of transactional data from over 400 million active users, the company is building a platform that allows merchants to create highly targeted and effective marketing campaigns. This advertising arm, though still in its early stages, has the potential to generate billions in annual revenue. Even modest success here could have a significant impact on PayPal’s top line, creating another compelling growth driver.

Innovation has always been at the heart of PayPal’s strategy, and recent developments like the Fastlane checkout system showcase its commitment to staying ahead. This one-click guest checkout feature, paired with partnerships with major platforms like Shopify and Fiserv, enhances the company’s offerings for merchants and consumers alike. Meanwhile, initiatives like the CashPass rewards program deepen user engagement and loyalty, ensuring that PayPal remains a go-to solution for everyday transactions.

Leadership will play a critical role in PayPal’s resurgence, and newly appointed CEO Alex Chriss appears well-suited for the task. With a proven track record at Intuit, Chriss has demonstrated his ability to foster innovation and deliver results. His focus on empowering small businesses aligns perfectly with PayPal’s strengths and provides a roadmap for future growth.

But the journey back to a P/E of 43 will require more than just strategic initiatives and innovation. PayPal needs to rebuild investor confidence. The company must consistently deliver strong earnings, improve operational efficiencies, and effectively communicate its vision to the market. Transparent updates on key growth areas—such as PYUSD adoption, advertising revenue, and merchant partnerships—will be crucial in shaping the market’s perception of PayPal’s potential.

A return to PayPal’s historical valuation isn’t just about numbers; it’s about the story the company tells and the trust it rebuilds with investors. If PayPal can execute on its strategy, the potential reward is not just a higher stock price but a reaffirmation of its position as a leader in the fintech space. For those willing to look beyond the current market sentiment, PayPal’s path to $246 offers a compelling narrative of transformation, growth, and untapped opportunity.

TL;DR: PayPal is undervalued at a P/E of 20 compared to its historical average of 43. To return to its peak valuation, it must capitalize on its stablecoin (PYUSD), grow its new advertising business, and leverage innovative products like Fastlane Checkout. Under CEO Alex Chriss, with strategic execution and strong earnings, PayPal could see a stock price of $246 by 2025, reaffirming its leadership in fintech.","PayPal, once a darling of the fintech space, has seen its valuation contract significantly over the past few years.

1 SK is the sole distributor of Bloom in Korea at this time so Bloom doesn’t get too involved in the market directly. I’m not clear on any exclusivity we require in this respect but they are incentivized as sole distributor to move our products. 

2 The fuel cell stacks themselves can support hydrogen directly but the equipment is optimized to natural gas today. Pure or blended hydrogen requires some modifications from our core Natural Gas product to enable, all of which were ready to deliver today. The H2 market is just not robust enough for us to be delivering these today. Lots of chatter but in the end the price and delivery networks are not where they need to be for scaling so focus is on ease of transition of Day 1 natural gas projects to H2 as it becomes more readily available. 

3 This all said we do have frequent requests to evaluate H2 projects as the market for supply does ramp up.

Personal note … in the US I expect H2 via electrolysis (another product offering we provide) to green up the NG grid by increasing H2 concentration in the supply before direct H2 pipelines ever become viable. There is a ceiling here as legacy NG infrastructure can only support up to ~15% H2 blending by volume due to materials used in these systems. Also H2 is less energy dense so much higher volumes need to be delivered to generate the same level of power so it’s a large infrastructure problem to solve.","A few points -

🚀 **SNOW Stock Analysis & Options Strategies** 🚀

Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) is showing **strong bullish momentum**, currently trading at **$173.70**, rallying sharply from its $107.13 low earlier this year. The recent uptrend has been supported by high volume and favorable technical indicators, but the RSI is at **89**, signaling overbought conditions and potential short-term consolidation.

**📊 Key Levels to Watch:**

* **Resistance:** $180 (immediate), $200 (psychological level)
* **Support:** $150–$152 (moving average), $140 (prior consolidation)

**💡 Options Strategies for SNOW:**

1. **Bull Call Spread** (Best for Moderate Bullish Outlook):
   * Buy a $175 call, sell a $190 call.
   * Limited risk, profit if SNOW breaks above $180.
2. **Long Call** (Best for Aggressive Bulls):
   * Buy a $175 call (30–60 days out).
   * Unlimited upside if SNOW rallies past $180.
3. **Cash-Secured Put** (Best for Conservative Investors):
   * Sell a $150 put.
   * Collect premium or buy SNOW at a discount if it dips.
4. **Iron Condor** (For Neutral Outlook):
   * Sell $180 call/$150 put, buy $190 call/$140 put.
   * Profits if SNOW stays between $150–$180.

SNOW’s strong recovery and proximity to resistance at $180 make it an exciting candidate for breakout plays, but overbought RSI suggests caution. Watch for movement above $180 to confirm the next leg up! 🚀

What are your thoughts? Are you playing SNOW with options or staying on the sidelines? 🧐

Hi investing friends, granted calculations say TSLA is overbought by around 7 to 8x  but if we go back in time and imagine it's today, could TSLA be at an era when it was good for Warren to buy Wrigley's stocks or Coca Cola stocks?

I get Buffett's picks which are first en masse, second they are consumables, 3rd they are simple to make and simple to consume so the turnover for them to make them again is faster(nothing hard in making gum and softdrinks once perfected and there's nothing hard about chewing and drinking Coke), 4th don't require R and D at some point, I call them en masse consumables. But we have to define consumable, it doesn't have to stop with one person, it can go on to almost forever with the next generations.

Having said that could TSLA be the era for this generation and generations close to it: it's en masse, everybody needs to commute, driving's one's self is convenient, it's consumable in a way coz' you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually (also energy is bought from Tesla via the superchargers among other things) and there's always new graduates to buy them, 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as it's as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum (automation + now w/ A.I.), 4th it does require constant R and D but then again technology compensates for that as if there's not much further R and D (especially with A.I. helping with a vehicle's physics and material science).

Thank you for reading.

2024-11-29,KO,wallstreetbets,post,1h2qivt,,,"Quadrupled Down. Stock still at Lows, still Sub-$2B Market Cap, $600M FCF, $4B in Assets, and Over 30% Short - Still Absurd.","Quadrupled Down. Stock still at Lows, still Sub-$2B Market Cap, $600M FCF, $4B in Assets, and Over 30% Short - Still Absurd.
My post about Kohl’s sparked a ton of discussion, so I wanted to address some of the recurring comments and clarify a few things. Here's the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h0dgpq/stock\_is\_trading\_at\_alltime\_lows\_with\_a\_sub2b/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h0dgpq/stock_is_trading_at_alltime_lows_with_a_sub2b/)


1. I quadrupled Down: Throughout the day, I added to my position every time I read a bearish comment that ignored the three core pillars of the thesis: Kohl’s cash position, net asset value, and dividend yield. **As of now, I’m $130K deep into this trade.**
2. This is a pure value play: Kohl’s isn’t suddenly going to become the next Amazon, and that’s fine. The thesis isn’t predicated on some retail turnaround miracle. This is a simple value play: I’m buying $2 worth of assets for $1. Kohl’s NAV dwarfs its market cap, and it throws off real cash flow.
3. New CEO: the markets reaction (and many of the comments) was that the new CEO is a bearish signal, makes no sense. The new CEO is the guy who turned around Michaels in 2020 and SOLD IT TO APOLLO FOR $3B. The worst thing about Kohls management thus far has been their desire to not liquidate its most valuable asset (real estate) and instead simply return cash flow to shareholders. I’m not complaining about the latter, but the former would’ve been an $8B sale in 2022 if management had agreed to it. Currently trading for $1.5B with the same real estate assets on the book.
4. Bag Holding vs. Conviction: There are times when you feel like a bag holder and hopium is your drug. And then there are times where when it goes down you calmly buy more. And in the latter times, you want to bring everyone along for the ride. Getting rich alone isn’t meaningful. 

Stay tuned

2024-11-30,KO,stocks,comment,1h3465k,lzsbl7w,t1_lzs7mpt,,"> That is a lot of imagination.

Is it though?  Compared to building entire lines of beautiful high tech electric vehicles from scratch, it’s not.

If I sold cakes and was constrained by my frosting supplier, I’d be figuring out how to make my own frosting by morning. And in so doing, I’d be making better and cheaper frosting and removing a point of failure.  

Considering the miles they’ve already come, this could be like an inch  of a step for Rivian.


> think the biggest hurdle is the market for electric cars. Almost half the people who have bought electric vehicles in North America say their next car will be an ICE vehicle

This is the big myth.  Rivian doesn’t need to sell 350 million vehicles to 350 million Americans.  The stock will explode if they can do 0.1% of that.  

As such, it doesn’t matter if 50% of people hate EVs and 50% of the ones who don’t hate Rivian and 50% of the rest can’t afford it, etc.

I personally don’t understand why anyone buys goop or Pepsi or air fryers.  But I know that there’s enough people who do that it’s completely meaningless what my personal preference or really anyone’s individual anecdotal tastes are.  As long as there’s 300 people who want to buy the 100 Ferraris being produced, you’ve got yourself a hot business.  Rivian just needs 51,000 people who want to buy the 50,000 cars they make, rinse and repeat.  

> Add to that, Trump is going to remove the EV tax credit and it is becoming less an issue about production capacity and more about market desire.

Again, the people who are going to care about that don’t matter.  

I see people spending a fortune on known lemons every day.  They buy emotionally, not on penny pinching, especially with higher dollar purchases.

Pop over to Rivian sub.  There’s electicians who realized that swapping their $1500 gasoline cost per month for a $1000 Rivian payment and a $100 charging bill is money maker, so why should they care about an EV credit?

That’s part of the beauty of being small.  Rivian doesn’t have to be the affordable car for every human.  They only need to find 50,000 affluent customers this year, which they have.


> There isn't going to be another player enter the market and be the next tesla because when tesla did it, they had next to no competition.

I heard this identical fallacy about Intel.  And blackberry.  And Cisco.  And Enron.  And Gateway.  And so on.  

Remember, Rivian doesn’t need to replace Tesla and Coca Cola, they just need to find their customers at the right intersection of product and price.  

> or some gamechanging technology, which rivian does not.

What’s “gamechanging” about Apple’s 17 version of a phone?  Or “gamechanging” about Celsius Soda or Red Bull Soda or Monster Soda or Pepsi Soda?  They’ve all eaten fine while so has hundred year old Coca Cola.

I have no idea what you're trying to say here. Can you rephrase that?

>2) can avoid taxes alltogether, cause they know how.

They can avoid taxes precisely because

1) there aren't enough qualified IRS investigators to catch them

2) because they pay Congress to deliberately keep loopholes open. This is entirely the conservative agenda, and this is why they fabricate excuses to keep government ""small"", get rid of basic regulations, and hilariously label campaign finance as ""free speech"", so billionaires like the Koch brothers and Elon Musk can continue to donate billions in order to be able to cheat their employees with unsafe working conditions as well as the consumer with unhealthy or unsafe products.

As for the bit about poor people, as I explained above, IRS generally never goes after poor people because it's not worth their time. There is no point going after 50 tax evaders who owe $10k each, when they can go after one tax evader who owes $10m.

If you owed $10k and you've been caught, it was most likely an anonymous tip-off from someone who knows you. It's also likely that you're committing a more serious crime that raised red flags, then got caught for tax evasion as an unintended consequence.","WHAT is the point?

COO Ken Kovan has stated that a new paper(s) based on previously halted IMV research, would be written and released for this conference.  No preclinical data for mRNA cancer vaccine potential has been published by IMV (that I can find), yet CEO Passin has been stating that DPX is uniquely qualified for mRNA personalized cancer vax.  I am hoping for a paper on this as they have connected with IMV scientists whose research was halted by IMV CEO Andrew Hall in the Fall of 2022 prior to IMV Bankruptcy in May 2023.  All research except MVP-S was halted at that time.

I anticipate a news release on Monday-ish so that they can openly discuss any new findings at the conference/summit (12/3-12/5), before their presentation on 12/5 at 4pm.  If you look at the line up of presenters, it is a pretty prestigious group.

Any new papers would be a catalyst, but real movement will be seen with DPX licensing deals/revenue (which they are beginning to seek - for instance at the 12/3 conference/summit), a partnership deal for MVP-S for ovarian & Lymphoma phase 3 ready and in discussion with a Shanghai based pharma (I believe this may be Beta/Betta pharma), potential BARDA RRPV (RAPID RESPONSE PARTNERSHIP VEHICLE - Anthrax?) to which they were just invited and accepted in November 2024, and potential funding from Nova Scotia to reopen labs there.  2025/2026 catalysts are Zoetis and SpayVac revenue from licensing agreements on a ""pre-DPX"" version for contraception in wild animals (invasive horses, elephants, deer ..), farmed fish & cattle.  Both companies are awaiting approval for commercial use - Zoetis for cattle in Brazil & Australia, SpayVac for all other.

These are not traditional catalysts, but I prefer them to waiting for the latest PDUFA, especially with who knows what shake ups are on the way there.

Interestingly, I have wondered if Brad Sorensen of Zacks Small Cap Research will begin coverage soon.  Zacks tweeted their 9/19 interview with CEO Passin today, ahead of 12/3-5 Cancer Summit.  I'm assuming they are wanting ink on a revenue deal to initiate coverage.

I used to look for a buy out, but now hoping for licensing deals, partnerships and progress in peanut allergy studies with partner AP Visionaries.  

These lipid nanoparticle licensing deals are just too lucrative to think buyout is the best option at this time:

Indicators:

1. Price Action:

	•	The stock reached a high of $12.23 but has pulled back slightly.
	•	Short-term support seems to be forming around $11.50.
	•	Resistance remains at $12, which aligns with psychological resistance and recent highs.

2. Bollinger Bands:

	•	The price is near the upper Bollinger Band, which suggests the stock might be in overbought territory in the short term.
	•	The narrowing of the bands could indicate consolidation before the next breakout or pullback.

3. MACD:

	•	The MACD line is above the signal line, confirming bullish momentum.
	•	However, the histogram is starting to shrink, hinting at a possible slowdown in momentum.

4. RSI:

	•	The RSI is around 70, indicating overbought conditions. This suggests caution as the stock could face short-term selling pressure.

Support and Resistance Levels:

	•	Support:
	•	$11.50: Immediate short-term support, as seen from recent price action.
	•	$11.00: A more significant support level where previous consolidation occurred.
	•	$10.35: Stronger support, marking the recent low.
	•	Resistance:
	•	$12.00: Immediate resistance, both psychological and technical.
	•	$12.23: The recent high, which will be the next hurdle to break.

Bullish vs. Bearish Outlook:

Bullish Signs:

	•	Price remains above both the midline of the Bollinger Bands and key support levels.
	•	MACD is still positive, indicating upward momentum.
	•	Consolidation near resistance suggests that buyers are not giving up easily.

Bearish Signs:

	•	RSI in overbought territory could lead to a short-term pullback.
	•	Shrinking MACD histogram points to weakening momentum.
	•	Resistance at $12 might prove challenging to break without strong volume.

Conclusion:

The stock is in a short-term consolidation phase within a larger bullish trend. If the price breaks above $12 with strong volume, it could target $12.50 or higher. However, failure to break resistance could result in a pullback to $11.50 or even $11.

If you’re trading this, watch for:
	•	A breakout above $12 for continuation.

I’ve been doing some digging into Eastman Kodak (KODK), and I’m starting to think it’s flying under the radar. Right now, Kodak is trading at a market cap of ~$500M, but their plans to enter the API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) business could make that valuation look ridiculously cheap.

Here’s the scoop:

API Market Opportunity: The U.S. API market is projected to grow from $35.8B in 2024 to $65.7B by 2032 (CAGR of ~8%). Kodak aims to capture up to 25% of the U.S. API market for non-biologic, non-antibacterial generic drugs. That’s a potential $8B annual revenue opportunity.

Facility Progress: Kodak’s API manufacturing facility is nearing completion at Eastman Business Park, with production set to start in 2025. They’re leveraging their expertise in chemical manufacturing to tackle supply chain shortages in the U.S.

Valuation Gap: If Kodak captures even a fraction of this market share, its current valuation seems absurdly low. For context, an $8B annual revenue stream could position Kodak for a multi-billion-dollar market cap in the future.

Risks: Of course, there are hurdles—regulatory approvals, competition, and the ability to execute at scale. Plus, this is a pivot from their traditional business model, so there’s execution risk.

What do you all think? Is this a case of Wall Street sleeping on a potential giant, or is the risk too high for Kodak to make a real impact in the API space?

Would love to hear your thoughts!","I’ve been doing some digging into Eastman Kodak (KODK), and I’m starting to think it’s flying under the radar.
