DB Take: Expect strong outlook despite Blackwell delay
Research Analyst
Despite an uncharacteristic product delay, we expect another strong quarter and
+1-212-250-2134
guide from NVDA, reflecting ongoing demand for AI compute capacity across a
DJ Sebastian
broad base of customers (cloud/hyperscaler/consumer internet/sovereigns). While
Research Associate
revenue upside in the quarter itself may not be as significant in magnitude as prior
+1-415-262-2007
quarters (average revenue beat ~$2b in the last five quarters; DBe beat closer to $1b
in the October quarter), we expect this to be more than made up for in the
company's January-quarter guidance, with NVDA indicating Blackwell could
contribute "several billions" of revenues in that quarter ($38b+ rev guide?). With
such revenue momentum remaining in NVDA's favor, we believe the key questions
weighing on the shares include: 1) How sustainable is current demand (how fast will
CY26 revs grow)? 2) What impact (if any) will margin pressure have on earnings
(price increases on new products unlikely to offset cost increases)?. All told, we
continue to take a very positive view on NVDA's execution in the all-important end
market of AI and see potential for this momentum to ultimately yield EPS power in
the $5+ range. However, with the shares having risen substantially in recent
months and already implying ~30x that $5 earnings potential, we view the shares
as fully valued at these levels. We maintain our Hold rating.
F3Q25 (Oct) Results: Another beat expected
We expect NVDA to deliver October-quarter revenue of $33.1b (+10% q/q), in line
with the Street at $33.1b and slightly above the midpoint of guidance of $32.5b.
Once again, we expect NVDA to beat the guidance midpoint handily (average beat
of ~$2b in the last 5 quarters), albeit with the magnitude potentially smaller than in
past quarters (we think ~$1b more likely). By end market, we model Data Center rev
growing 10% q/q to ~$29.0b (+$2.7b q/q) on continued growth in Hopper
shipments, even ahead of the Blackwell launch (DBe risk of "air pocket" is TMG
diminished in light of the Blackwell delay). We model Gaming revenue growing 15%
q/q, while we see Proviz rev flat q/q, and Auto +10% q/q. For margins, we model the 60:62:32
GM contracting 70bps q/q to 75%, in line with guidance, and we see opex growing
7% q/q to $3.00b (in line with guidance of $3.00b). All told, we see October-quarter
PF EPS of $0.74 vs. the Street at $0.74. 4202/11/31

F4Q25 (Jan) Guide: Expect strong guide on Blackwell ramp
We currently forecast NVDA F4Q25 revenue of $37.2b (+12% q/q, +69% y/y), above
Street estimate at $36.8b (+11% q/q), reflecting "several billions" of revenue
contribution from Blackwell. With this said, we acknowledge upside risk to this
estimate given NVDA's track record of beating Street expectations, as well as
robust capex commentary across cloud/hyperscale customers this earnings
season. We model Data Center rev growing 15% q/q to $33.2b (+$4.3b q/q) on the
initial ramp of Blackwell. We model Gaming rev declining 5% q/q on seasonality.
Last, we see Proviz rev declining 5% q/q and Automotive +10% q/q. On margins, we
see the GM decreasing 200bps to 73%, in line with guidance as Blackwell volumes
weigh on GMs initially. We see opex growing 8% q/q to $3.22b, yielding January-
quarter EPS of $0.82, in line with the Street at $0.81.

Equity rating dispersion and banking relationships
Equity Rating and Dispersion Key
T he Equity Rating Dispersion Chart depicts the following:
The proportion of recommendations that are rated "buy", "sell" and "hold" over the previous 12 months. This is shown for
securities issued in the stated region e.g. "Europe Universe". See rating definitions below. This is represented by the
"Companies Covered" bars in the chart. The percentage value displayed above the bar is the proportion as a percentage.
E.g. 50% above the “buy” / “Companies Covered” bar means that 50% of DB’s equity research covered companies over
t he past 12 months have a “buy” rating.
Next to each of the three respective bars showing the proportion of "buy", "sell" and "hold" recommendations we provide
t wo additional bars to show:
- The proportion of "buy", "sell" or "hold recommendations where Deutsche Bank and or/Affiliates provided MIFID
Investment or Ancillary Services in the past 12 months. This is represented in the "MIFID Investment and Ancillary
Services" bar. The percentage value displayed above the bar shows the proportion of Companies Covered with the given
rating where DB has also provided MIFID Investment and Ancillary Services in the past 12 months. E.g. 50% above the
“Cos. w/ MIFID Investment and Ancillary Services” bar means 50% of the Companies Covered with the rating stated have
a lso received MIFID Investment and Ancillary Services from DB.
- The proportion of "buy" (or "sell" or "hold) recommendations where Deutsche Bank and or/Affiliates has provided
Investment Banking services in the past 12 months for which it has received compensation. The percentage value
displayed above the bar shows the proportion of Companies Covered with the stated rating where DB has also provided
Investment Banking services in the past 12 months. E.g. 50% above the “Cos. w/ Investment Banking relationship” bar
m eans 50% of the Companies Covered with the rating stated also have an Investment Banking Relationship with DB.
B uy: Based on a current 12- month view of TSR, we recommend that investors buy the stock.
S ell: Based on a current 12-month view of TSR, we recommend that investors sell the stock.
Hold: We take a neutral view on the stock 12-months out and, based on this time horizon, do not recommend either a
B uy or Sell.
TSR = Total Shareholder Return. Percentage change in share price from current price to projected target price plus
p rojected dividend yield
N ewly issued research recommendations and target prices supersede previously published research.

Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or events that may have a near-

affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay
fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases
in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the
maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in
inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to
receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets
holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency
conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are
also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed-income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by
indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in
emerging markets. The index fixings may - by construction - lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables
they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating
coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons.
Funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps
(swaptions) the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The appropriateness

financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss
in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable
in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited - up to
theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an

in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are affected by the currency of an

research refers to any particular financial product recipients of the research should consider any product disclosure statement,
prospectus or other applicable disclosure document before making any decision about whether to acquire the product. In
preparing this report, the primary analyst or an individual who assisted in the preparation of this report has likely been in contact
with the company that is the subject of this research for confirmation/clarification of data, facts, statements, permission to use
company-sourced material in the report, and/or site-visit attendance. Without prior approval from Research Management,
analysts may not accept from current or potential Banking clients the costs of travel, accommodations, or other expenses
incurred by analysts attending site visits, conferences, social events, and the like. Similarly, without prior approval from
Research Management and Anti-Bribery and Corruption ("ABC") team, analysts may not accept perks or other items of value
for their personal use from issuers they cover.
Additional information relative to securities, other financial products or issuers discussed in this report is available upon
request. This report may not be reproduced, distributed or published without Deutsche Bank's prior written consent.
Backtested, hypothetical or simulated performance results have inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record
based on trading actual client portfolios, simulated results are achieved by means of the retroactive application of a backtested
model itself designed with the benefit of hindsight. Taking into account historical events the backtesting of performance also
differs from actual account performance because an actual inve
stment strategy may be adjusted any time, for any reason,
including a response to material, economic or market factors. The backtested performance includes hypothetical results that
do not reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings or the deduction of advisory fees, brokerage or other
commissions, and any other expenses that a client would have paid or actually paid. No representation is made that any trading
strategy or account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. Alternative modeling techniques or
assumptions might produce significantly different results and prove to be more appropriate. Past hypothetical backtest results
are neither an indicator nor guarantee of future returns. Actual results will vary, perhaps materially, from the analysis.
The method for computing individual E,S,G and composite ESG scores set forth herein is a novel method developed by the
Research department within Deutsche Bank AG, computed using a systematic approach without human intervention.
Different data providers, market sectors and geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of
ways. As such, the ESG scores referred to herein may differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other ESG
data providers in the market and may also differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other divisions within
the Deutsche Bank Group. Such ESG scores also differ from other ratings and rankings that have historically been applied in
research reports published by Deutsche Bank AG. Further, such ESG scores do not represent a formal or official view of
Deutsche Bank AG. It should be noted that the decision to incorporate ESG factors into any investment strategy may inhibit
the ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise would be consistent with your investment objective
and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio consisting primarily of sustainable investments may be
lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered, and the
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ. Companies may not necessarily meet high performance
standards on all aspects of ESG or sustainable investing issues; there is also no guarantee that any company will meet
expectations in connection with corporate responsibility, sustainability, and/or impact performance.
