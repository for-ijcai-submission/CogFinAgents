NVIDIA reported Oct results (revenue/GMs/EPS ) above consensus estimates (in-line with market expectations), and off of a higher Oct-Qtr revenue base, the team guided to a 7% Q/Q increase in the Jan-Qtr, in-line with consensus (but slightly below market expectations) on continued strong spending from its customers to support their AI/accelerated compute initiatives (both training/inference), initial production ramp of the Blackwell platform on top of continued strong demand pull for its Hopper H100/H200. The team expects continued strength in Hopper shipments into 2025 even as next-gen Blackwell shipment continues to ramp higher. The team is driving strong product/manufacturing execution with Blackwell revenues tracking ahead of its initial expectation of "several billion dollars" for the Jan-Qtr. Demand for Blackwell is very strong and will continue to outstrip supply for several quarters into CY25. Supply tightness is broad and not just limited to CoWoS and HBM but the team is gradually unlocking supply as we move through CY25. China sales, we estimate were low-teens% of datacenter revenues in the Oct-Qtr and was a strong contributor but continues to be below its peak levels of 25%. On networking, the business is down 15% Q/Q due to timing issues (e.g. data center readiness) and supply shortages related to the optics, transceivers, and cabling businesses but partially offset by strength in Infiniband, ethernet switches, and SmartNICs. The team is working through the supply shortage issues and we expect networking growth to be more in-sync with the datacenter compute in CY25. Software is also gaining strong traction led by Nvidia AI enterprise and is expected to approach $2B in annual run-rate exiting this year (from $1.5B annualized revenue run-rate in the Oct-Qtr). GM is expected to trend lower in the Apr-Qtr (we estimate 71-72% GM), we believe driven by higher ramp up costs/lower production yields of new Blackwell solutions. We expect gross margins to improve throughout next year on improving yields and better cost absorption and reach mid-70s in the 2H of next year. Bottom line, the team continues to maintain a 1-2 step lead ahead of competitors with its silicon/hardware/software platforms, and a strong ecosystem (4M CUDA software developers) and the team is further distancing itself with its aggressive cadence of new product launches and more product segmentation over time. We increase our forward estimates and increase our Dec-25 PT to $170 (from our prior PT of $155), and reiterate our OW rating.

Investment Thesis and Valuation
Investment Thesis
We believe NVIDIA continues to execute across all segments. While 1H is typically seasonally weaker than 2H, we expect solid demand in PC gaming to be a strong revenue driver for the company, offsetting PC OEM, which is in secular decline. We expect the data center segment to grow strongly as hyperscale customers continue to embrace GPU-accelerated deep learning for processing large data sets. We are encouraged by strength in the automotive and enterprise segments as well, although strong adoption of autonomous driving in the market remains to be seen. We anticipate significant upside in the shares, driving our Overweight rating.

Valuation
Our Dec-25 PT assumes that NVIDIA trades at a 35x multiple applied to ~$4.90 of annualized earnings power exiting CY25E ($1.23 *4). Our earnings multiple is consistent with its potential earnings CAGR of 30-35%+ over the next few years led by the continued strong datacenter growth, monetizing an incremental ~$14B of auto revenue pipeline and incremental software, licensing, and subscription revenues over the next several years.

• Strong F3Q25 (Oct-Qtr) results led by continued strong AI demand pull and
ramp of H100/200 platforms. NVIDIA reported F3Q25 revenue of $35.1B (up
17% Q/Q), above consensus ($33.3B) led by the continued strong demand pull for
its its Datacenter solutions. Datacenter revenue grew 17% Q/Q on strong demand
pull for H200 platform ramp (DataCenter Compute up 22% Q/Q). Networking (
down 15% Q/Q) were soft due to timing issues (e.g. data center readiness)and
supply shortages related to the optics, transceivers, and cabling businesses but
partially offset by strength in Infiniband, ethernet switches, and SmartNICs. Gaming
revenues were up 14% Q/Q on seasonal strength. Pro Vis grew 14% Q/Q. Auto was
up 30% Q/Q on continued ramp of its intelligent cockpit compute solutions and
autonomous platforms. GM of 75.0% in-line with consensus (75.0%). EPS of $0.81
was above consensus. We estimate that China datacenter revenues were about low-
teens of the datacenter mix in the Oct-Qtr.
• F4Q25 (Jan-Qtr) guidance above consensus on continued strong datacenter
demand and initial Blackwell production ramp. J an-Q revenue guidance of
$37.5B (up 7% Q/Q),slightly above consensus ( $37.1B) on continued strong
Datacenter demand and initial Blackwell production ramp. At the midpoint, in
F3Q25, the team sees Q/Q growth led by strong Q/Q datacenter growth while
gaming is down Q/Q on supply constraints. GM is expected to be 73.5%. OpEx is
guided to $3.4B. Implied EPS is $0.83, slightly above consensus of $0.82.
• Blackwell production ramps progressing well…and the team remains supply
constrained on Blackwell through majority of CY25. D emand was strong for AI
inference and training. On Blackwell, the team is driving strong product/
manufacturing execution with Blackwell revenues tracking ahead of its initial
expectation of “several billion dollars” for the Jan-Qtr. Demand for Blackwell is
very strong and will outstrip supply for several quarters into CY25.
• Increasing forward estimates and increasing our Dec-25 PT to $170. We
increase our forward estimates. We increase our PT to $170 (from prior PT of $155).
We remain Overweight NVDA. Our PT assumes that NVIDIA trades at a 35x
multiple applied to ~$4.90 of annualized earnings power exiting CY25E.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
NVIDIA Corporation (Overweight; Price Target: $170.00)
Investment Thesis
We believe NVIDIA continues to execute across all segments. While 1H is typically
seasonally weaker than 2H, we expect solid demand in PC gaming to be a strong revenue
driver for the company, offsetting PC OEM, which is in secular decline. We expect the data
center segment to grow strongly as hyperscale customers continue to embrace GPU-
accelerated deep learning for processing large data sets. We are encouraged by strength in
the automotive and enterprise segments as well, although strong adoption of autonomous
driving in the market remains to be seen. We anticipate significant upside in shares, driving
our Overweight rating.
Valuation
Our Dec-25 PT assumes that NVIDIA trades at a 35x multiple applied to ~$4.90 of
annualized earnings power exiting CY25E ($1.23 *4). Our earnings multiple is consistent
with its potential earnings CAGR of 30-35%+ over the next few years led by the continued
strong datacenter growth, monetizing an incremental ~$14B of auto revenue pipeline and
incremental software, licensing, and subscription revenues over the next several years.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
• Although PC gaming demand seems resilient to macroeconomic weakness, any macro
uncertainty could weigh on PC gaming demand trends. Given NVDA’s ~53% exposure
to the PC gaming segment, any consumer PC gaming weakness poses downside risk to
our estimates.
• NVIDIA’s GPUs could gain lower than expected deployment into data center
applications as hyperscale customers further adopt deep learning as a new and effective
way of processing large unstructured data sets. Any significant decrease in the adoption
of deep learning by hyperscale customers or increase in competition could result in
downside risk to our revenue and earnings estimates.

the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the

this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s

because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the

country market index, not to those Research Analysts’ coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report,
