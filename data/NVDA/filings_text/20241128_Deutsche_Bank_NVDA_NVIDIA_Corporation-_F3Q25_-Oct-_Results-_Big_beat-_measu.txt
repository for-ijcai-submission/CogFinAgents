NVDA delivered another trademark beat/raise, albeit with the shape a bit different
than we expected with the F3Q "beat" being larger than expected and the F4Q
"raise" a bit smaller. Regardless of the shape, the aggregate of the two quarters
yields impressive growth and positive revisions to our estimates, with the company
importantly highlighting that its Blackwell ramp is ahead of schedule vs. its prior
target of "several billions of revenue" in F4Q and more thereafter (also disarming
recent concerns of power issues). Beyond the Data Center strength, the company
also calmed fears of Blackwell-related GM pressures, citing expectations for a
return to ~75% GMs in 2H of FY26 (CY25). Overall, NVDA continues to illustrate its
technological dominance in AI accelerators, with its lead seemingly growing vs
competition with the introduction of Blackwell. As a result, our CY25/26 PF EPS ests
rise by an avg of ~+15%. While NVDA's execution remains strong and its growth
impressive in nearly any historical context, we believe much of this goodness is
reflected in its share price. Consequently, based on our sector-wide move to CY26-
based valuation multiples, we raise our P/T to $140 (P/E of 27x of FY27/CY26E of
$5.20), but maintain our Hold rating.

Positives outweigh negatives
Positives: 1) NVDA is seeing no sign of slowing demand for its AI compute
solutions, with demand for Blackwell products in particular characterized as
"staggering". As a result, mgmt indicated it was ahead of plan vs. its prior target of
delivering "several billions" of Blackwell revenue in F4Q (Jan), augmenting
continued demand for Hopper. 2) While Gross Margin concerns had arisen on its
prior call (Blackwell ramp is initially dilutive), NVDA sees these headwinds as
temporary, with GMs potentially returning to the mid-70s level by 2H FY26 (CY25).
3) NVDA's cash returns remain robust, with the company buying back $11b in
shares in F3Q alone (DBe ~$30b+ in buybacks by the end of FY25). Negatives: 1)
While NVDA's qtr/guide was still healthier than our expectations (revenues +5%
ahead of DBe in aggregate), the mix was more heavily skewed towards F3Q than
F4Q. Thus, the F4Q (Jan) guide was only "in-line" with investor expectations, a
deviation from prior quarters. 2) While demand for Hopper-based systems
remained robust in Oct-qtr, Networking revenues fell -15% q/q (unclear why, as
most key networking products grew q/q). With this said, NVDA noted it expects a
reacceleration of this business going forward (up q/q in F4Q). 3) NVDA is once again
seeing supply constraints limiting revenue potential, and is working with its
hundreds of components suppliers to alleviate bottlenecks (in both DC & Gaming).

Big beat, slight raise

NVDA reported Oct-qtr revenues of $35.1b (+17% q/q, +94% y/y), well above
guidance/DBe of $32.5b/$33.1b and the Street at $33.3b. By end market, Data
Center revs beat our expectations (+$1.9b above DBe). Gaming revs were in-line
with our expectations (+14% q/q vs DBe +15% q/q), Proviz revs of $486m (+7% q/q
vs. DBe flat q/q) were above our expectations, Auto revs of $449m (+30% q/q vs.
DBe +10% q/q) were above our ests, and OEM/Other revs of $97m were in-line with
our ests at $97m. PF GMs came in at 75.0%, vs. guidance 75.0%, and PF Opex came
in at $3.05b vs. guidance/DBe $3.00b. All told, Oct-qtr EPS totaled $0.81, above
DBe/Street at $0.74/$0.74 on better revs & a slightly lower tax rate. NVDA guided
revenues to $37.5b (+7% q/q), slightly above DBe/Street at $37.2b/$37.1, yet
slightly below buyside hopes. Non-GAAP GM was guided to 73.5% (vs. DBe
73.0%), with non-GAAP OpEx guided to $3.40b (vs. DBe $3.23b), yielding implied
non-GAAP EPS of ~$0.82, in-line with DBe/Street at $0.82/$0.82. All told, our
CY25E revs/EPS move to $190b (+46% y/y)/ $4.25 from $173b (+37% y/y)/ $3.85
prior, while our CY26E rev/EPS ests move to $226b (+19% y/y)/ $5.20 from $195b
(+13% y/y)/ $4.40.

Maintain Hold rating, raise P/T to $140
On higher estimates, we raise our P/T to $140 and maintain our Hold rating. Our P/T
is based on a multiple of ~27x our CY26 EPS estimates (vs. ~30x CY25E EPS prior),
as we shift our target valuation methodologies to CY26 ests across our coverage.
This multiple marks a premium to semi peers to reflect fast growth and strong
earnings momentum, but still represents a discount to the co's 5-year average.
Upside/downside risks include better-/worse-than-expected Gaming, Data Center,
Automotive, and OEM/Other revenue growth, higher-/lower-than-expected
profitability, macro, design win/product execution, and market share shifts.
Positive/negative company-specific risks include market share gains/losses in

Equity rating dispersion and banking relationships
Equity Rating and Dispersion Key
T he Equity Rating Dispersion Chart depicts the following:
The proportion of recommendations that are rated "buy", "sell" and "hold" over the previous 12 months. This is shown for
securities issued in the stated region e.g. "Europe Universe". See rating definitions below. This is represented by the
"Companies Covered" bars in the chart. The percentage value displayed above the bar is the proportion as a percentage.
E.g. 50% above the “buy” / “Companies Covered” bar means that 50% of DB’s equity research covered companies over
t he past 12 months have a “buy” rating.
Next to each of the three respective bars showing the proportion of "buy", "sell" and "hold" recommendations we provide
t wo additional bars to show:
- The proportion of "buy", "sell" or "hold recommendations where Deutsche Bank and or/Affiliates provided MIFID
Investment or Ancillary Services in the past 12 months. This is represented in the "MIFID Investment and Ancillary
Services" bar. The percentage value displayed above the bar shows the proportion of Companies Covered with the given
rating where DB has also provided MIFID Investment and Ancillary Services in the past 12 months. E.g. 50% above the
“Cos. w/ MIFID Investment and Ancillary Services” bar means 50% of the Companies Covered with the rating stated have
a lso received MIFID Investment and Ancillary Services from DB.
- The proportion of "buy" (or "sell" or "hold) recommendations where Deutsche Bank and or/Affiliates has provided
Investment Banking services in the past 12 months for which it has received compensation. The percentage value
displayed above the bar shows the proportion of Companies Covered with the stated rating where DB has also provided
Investment Banking services in the past 12 months. E.g. 50% above the “Cos. w/ Investment Banking relationship” bar
m eans 50% of the Companies Covered with the rating stated also have an Investment Banking Relationship with DB.
B uy: Based on a current 12- month view of TSR, we recommend that investors buy the stock.
S ell: Based on a current 12-month view of TSR, we recommend that investors sell the stock.
Hold: We take a neutral view on the stock 12-months out and, based on this time horizon, do not recommend either a
B uy or Sell.
TSR = Total Shareholder Return. Percentage change in share price from current price to projected target price plus
p rojected dividend yield
N ewly issued research recommendations and target prices supersede previously published research.

is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche Bank may act as
principal for its own account or as agent for another person.
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its own account
or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within Deutsche Bank,
including strategists, sales staff and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken in this research
report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked analysis,
quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may differ from
recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies, perspectives or
otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its affiliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes on. Analysts

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do not
necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides liquidity
for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes have
shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. Some trade ideas for
equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website (https://research.db.com/Research/) , and can be found on the
general coverage list and also on the covered company's page. A Catalyst Call represents a high-conviction belief by an analyst
that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a specified sector over a time frame of no less than two weeks
and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may occasionally discuss with our clients, and with
Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or events that may have a near-
term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally
counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has
no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate
changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and
company-specific economic prospects make it difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole
discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management, and the majority of reports are published at
irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account the particular
investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation of an offer to buy or
sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a
product of the analyst's judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and
investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of financial instruments are subject to
change without notice, and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and other factors. If a
financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely
affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude
transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous
trading session and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is also sourced from
Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and other parties.

research are available on our website (https://research.db.com/Research/) under Disclaimer.
Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay
fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases
in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the
maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in
inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to
receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets
holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency
conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are
also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed-income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by
indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in
emerging markets. The index fixings may - by construction - lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables
they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating
coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons.
Funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps
(swaptions) the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The appropriateness

of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their tax position, their
regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should take expert legal and
financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss
in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable
in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited - up to
theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an
option, investors must review the 'Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options", at https://www.theocc.com/company-
information/documents-and-archives/publications. If you are unable to access the website, please contact your Deutsche
Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i) exchange
rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by numerous market
factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes
in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are affected by the currency of an
underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at https://

research refers to any particular financial product recipients of the research should consider any product disclosure statement,
prospectus or other applicable disclosure document before making any decision about whether to acquire the product. In
preparing this report, the primary analyst or an individual who assisted in the preparation of this report has likely been in contact
with the company that is the subject of this research for confirmation/clarification of data, facts, statements, permission to use
company-sourced material in the report, and/or site-visit attendance. Without prior approval from Research Management,
analysts may not accept from current or potential Banking clients the costs of travel, accommodations, or other expenses
incurred by analysts attending site visits, conferences, social events, and the like. Similarly, without prior approval from
Research Management and Anti-Bribery and Corruption ("ABC") team, analysts may not accept perks or other items of value
for their personal use from issuers they cover.
Additional information relative to securities, other financial products or issuers discussed in this report is available upon
request. This report may not be reproduced, distributed or published without Deutsche Bank's prior written consent.
Backtested, hypothetical or simulated performance results have inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record
based on trading actual client portfolios, simulated results are achieved by means of the retroactive application of a backtested
model itself designed with the benefit of hindsight. Taking into account historical events the backtesting of performance also
differs from actual account performance because an actual investment strategy may be adjusted any time, for any reason,
including a response to material, economic or market factors. The backtested performance includes hypothetical results that
do not reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings or the deduction of advisory fees, brokerage or other
commissions, and any other expenses that a client would have paid or actually paid. No representation is made that any trading
strategy or account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. Alternative modeling techniques or
assumptions might produce significantly different results and prove to be more appropriate. Past hypothetical backtest results
are neither an indicator nor guarantee of future returns. Actual results will vary, perhaps materially, from the analysis.
The method for computing individual E,S,G and composite ESG scores set forth herein is a novel method developed by the
Research department within Deutsche Bank AG, computed using a systematic approach without human intervention.
Different data providers, market sectors and geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of
ways. As such, the ESG scores referred to herein may differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other ESG
data providers in the market and may also differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other divisions within
the Deutsche Bank Group. Such ESG scores also differ from other ratings and rankings that have historically been applied in
research reports published by Deutsche Bank AG. Further, such ESG scores do not represent a formal or official view of
Deutsche Bank AG. It should be noted that the decision to incorporate ESG factors into any investment strategy may inhibit
the ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise would be consistent with your investment objective
and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio consisting primarily of sustainable investments may be
lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered, and the
investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ. Companies may not necessarily meet high performance
standards on all aspects of ESG or sustainable investing issues; there is also no guarantee that any company will meet
expectations in connection with corporate responsibility, sustainability, and/or impact performance.

This text appears to be primarily contact information and organizational details for Deutsche Bank's research division, with some garbled text at the end. While it contains some structured information about personnel and locations, it doesn't contain substantive research content or analysis. The majority of the text is contact details and organizational hierarchy rather than original research content.

Based on my instructions to keep only substantive original content (title, institution, author, date, main body), this text doesn't qualify as it's essentially just contact information and organizational structure without any actual research content.

Therefore, I'll return an empty string.
