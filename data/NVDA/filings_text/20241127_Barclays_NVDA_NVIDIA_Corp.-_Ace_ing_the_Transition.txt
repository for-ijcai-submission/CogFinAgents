Ace-ing the Transition

The modest guide and GM commentary sets the next two quarters in a better spot as the company shifts its focus over to ramping Blackwell.

We think this was the perfect "thread the needle" guide, as the company both appeases investors on Jan and sets up April in a more reasonable spot. The company won't commit to Hopper growth in Jan but are indicating a Blackwell ramp better than the original guide of several billion. The two areas of pushback here are GMs, which start the year off in the "low 70s" before recovering later into the Blackwell ramp, and Networking, where we see a Q/Q decline likely due to some rip and replace H200 before Blackwell leads to upgrades. We think the stock works off of this as the NT is now de-risked and investor focus can now shift back to the upside potential of the greater Blackwell cycle, where we see volumes really stepping up significantly in 2H25.

Hopper Propels Another Solid Beat: October revenue beat at $35.1B (+17% Q/Q, vs. St. $33.3B)
driven again by Data Center, which was ahead at $30.8B (+17% Q/Q, vs. St. $29.1B) on continued
demand for the Hopper computing platform for LLM, recommendation engines and generative
AI applications. Within DC, Compute revenue was $27.6B (+22% Q/Q) and Networking was down
sequentially at $3.1B (-15% Q/Q), but exhibited sequential growth from InfiniBand and Ethernet
switches, SmartNICs, and BlueField DPUs. Cloud providers were 50% of DC revenue in October.
Gaming came in above at $3.28B (+14% Q/Q vs. St. at $3.06B), again due to higher sales of
GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs and game consoles SOCs. Auto came in above at $449M (+30% Q/Q
vs. St. $364M) due to strong performance in self-driving platforms. ProViz and OEM/Other both
came in just above at $486M (+7% Q/Q vs. St. $478M) and $97M (+10% Q/Q, vs. St. $89M),
respectively. ProViz benefited from the continued ramp of RTX GPU workstations based on the

Blackwell Picks Up Steam Leading to Top-Line Beat: Guides January revenue ahead to
$37.5B (+7% Q/Q vs. St. $37.1B) with Blackwell surpassing management’s expectations for
several billion in revenue. We model Data Center up +10% Q/Q with +10% Q/Q growth in
Compute and +10% Q/Q growth in Networking. We model Gaming down -7% due to supply
constraints, Auto up +5%, ProViz up +3%, and OEM & Other flat Q/Q. Guides GM in-line at 73.5%
and lower sequentially due to unfavorable mix from the Blackwell ramp. Guides opex higher to
$3.40B (vs. St. $3.25B), OIE to an income of $400M, and tax rate to 16.5%. All in, this nets an
implied EPS of $0.83, just above Street at $0.82. Looking further, management expects GMs to
moderate to the low-70s%, while Blackwell ramps, and then return to the mid-70s% in the 2H of
CY25 when Blackwell is fully up to speed. Additionally, management expects supply to stabilize
for Gaming in early CY25.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":
U.S. Semiconductors & Semiconductor Capital Equipment
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Allegro Microsystems (ALGM) Analog Devices (ADI)
Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) Arm Holdings plc (ARM) Astera Labs, Inc. (ALAB)

Sustainable Investing Related Research:There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a 'sustainable', 'ESG', 'green', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.
Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by Barclays or a third party ("Information"), in relation to any actual or potential 'ESG', 'sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes ("ESG Regimes"), unless otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification, label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes. Barclays has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.

Please be advised that any discussion of U.S. tax matters contained herein (including any attachments) (i) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, by you for the purpose of avoiding U.S. tax-related penalties; and (ii) was written to support the promotion or marketing of the transactions or other matters addressed herein.
