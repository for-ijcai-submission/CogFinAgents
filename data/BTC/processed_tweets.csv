But when he dilutes shares he adds BTC making every share worth more because each share represents even more BTC. This obviously doesn't work if BTC price crashes but there's a lot of good on the horizon for BTC so it makes it a great hold. 

Even in a bear market I don't plan on selling. Similar as to how I hold my BTC I only continue to add. Won't sell for another 20 or so years. 

My only caveat to this is I've always said I will cash out one BTC to buy a Lambo  if it ever hits 500k. Strictly for the lulz of course","It's the how he's financing that's the genius.

BTC was designed to be a store of value, and it is completely rational to speculate on whether or not it will fullfil its design goal, even if it has not yet done so.

""If you want a store of value, you want something not too volatile, therefore not speculative. When you want to bet on a massive upside (or perhaps certain asset to behave in a completely different way than what it does for its whole history) then you bet on a speculative asset such as bitcoin.""

Thank you captain obvious.

""The huge risk and volatility of bitcoin renders it incapable of being a store of value and if you make a bet that these characteristics will change in the future you are speculating that the behaviour the asset has had is going to change for some reason.""

Yes. That is what I mean by a sepculative store of value. Glad you finally get it. :)

""You cannot do that with a store of value, you need something where you don’t have to wish its behaviour changes in the future. You need something that has behaved in a relatively stable way for a very long time.""

Here's the reality:

1) Before this, Lightning wallets could not scan the proprietary (non-Lightning) QR code that Pick n Pay uses directly.

2) To pay with Lightning at PnP, you scan the code it our ""Crypto QR"" scanner application that launches the Lightning wallet. You don't notice it in the videos because it is pretty streamlined, but it is annoying to have two apps. More info: [https://www.moneybadger.co.za/pnp](https://www.moneybadger.co.za/pnp) (check ""How to pay with Lightning).

  
3) The Blink wallet developers came up with a brilliantly elegant solution to add support for proprietary QRs without adding proprietary APIs to the codebase, by using Lightning Addresses. Here is the pull request, it is a work of art: [https://github.com/GaloyMoney/galoy-client/pull/331/files](https://github.com/GaloyMoney/galoy-client/pull/331/files)

  
4) This code change is so non-invasive that ANY lightning wallet developer may add it, including non-custodial wallets.

I think it is incredibly sad that the mods removed this post, this small change has huge potential for Lightning adoption in South Africa.

  
I wrote about it here as well: [https://stacker.news/items/748849](https://stacker.news/items/748849)","Hi, we do the Pick n Pay integration and I need to set the record straight here. u/bottomupbitcoin is correct, this is actually new and, in my opinion, revolutionary.

2) To pay with Lightning at PnP, you scan the code it our ""Crypto QR"" scanner application that launches the Lightning wallet. You don't notice it in the videos because it is pretty streamlined, but it is annoying to have two apps. More info: [https://www.moneybadger.co.za/pnp](https://www.moneybadger.co.za/pnp) (check ""How to pay with Lightning).

  
3) The Blink wallet developers came up with a brilliantly elegant solution to add support for proprietary QRs without adding proprietary APIs to the codebase, by using Lightning Addresses. Here is the pull request, it is a work of art: [https://github.com/GaloyMoney/galoy-client/pull/331/files](https://github.com/GaloyMoney/galoy-client/pull/331/files)

  
4) This code change is so non-invasive that ANY lightning wallet developer may add it, including non-custodial wallets.

I think it is incredibly sad that the mods removed this post, this small change has huge potential for Lightning adoption in South Africa.

  
I wrote about it here as well: [https://stacker.news/items/748849](https://stacker.news/items/748849)",4,,,,reddit

I was sitting here thinking about how the value of Bitcoin increases and the rate at which it does, surpasses other assets. I’ve seen headlines stating Bitcoin or even a fraction of it will buy you a home, which seems great. Exchange one asset for another that appreciates. 

The problem is that Bitcoin appreciates at an astronomical rate compared to that of a house, so lets say each bitcoin is currently worth $100,000 and the home you want to purchase is $350,000. You pay 3.5 BTC for the home, but in 4 years each of those Bitcoin is now worth lets say $1,000,000. You would have essentially paid $3.5 million for a home valued at $350,000. 

Even if the value of the home doubled in the next 4 years, it still wouldn’t be anywhere close to what you paid using Bitcoin, ever!

Well there is one argument for that, and that is the fact that Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme lasted for **about 17 years, BUT...** If Bitcoin is a scam, then show me the scammer.

You cannot add to it, you cannot subtract from it. Finite, or to be more precise deflationary since Bitcoins get lost as people lost their wallets or die without children.

So I yet to find the scammer.

One could say Satoshi Nakamoto.

Alright let's work with that so let's say Satoshi is alive and he manages a rug pull.

Then what? He will be he richest person on earth in fiat currency and the Bitcoin he owned now owned by other people. Still cannot add to it, still cannot subtract from it, still finite, still deflationary, to be more precise.

It would drop the price then what? Life goes on. Bitcoin still have all the attributes which makes it the new gold, and there are no more giga whales in the pool. That's it, end of story.

Hi everyone,
I’m completely new to the world of cryptocurrencies and want to explore it out of curiosity, without big expectations. I plan to invest just a few dozen euros, mainly for fun and to understand how things work.

I’m currently using Bitpanda as my platform.

	2.	Any resources (articles, books, videos, etc.) to help me learn more about crypto?

If Bitcoin follows a pattern similar to the 2021 cycle, with an increase of about 40% above its moving averages, this would place Bitcoin’s peak at approximately $339,000. Assuming diminishing returns, Bitcoin’s price might only rise about 20% above the moving averages. In this case, the peak price would be closer to $200,000 by mid-2025.

Similarly, if the 2017 extended cycle repeats with diminishing returns, Bitcoin could peak at $466,000 in early 2026, while a more moderate increase might result in a peak price of around $388,000. Although it’s unlikely Bitcoin will hit one million dollars in this cycle, these more tempered projections could still represent substantial gains.

It's based on the initial dollar value of the investment, so if you bought 1 BTC at 20k, you'd pay 2,920 a year in fees.

But you ask a good question, and I was really curious about how this impacts the hypothetical situation above, so I did the math.

1.6B BTC at 5.6x leverage is about 9B of bitcoin. You'd pay about 1.314B in fees a year. After 2 years (Dec 2022 to Dec 2024), you pay about 2.6B in fees. This changes the final gain from about 51B to 48.4B, a 2925% increase instead of 3,106, which does significantly change the gain. However, you're still far ahead of the 2453% gain in MSTR over the same time period.

Hope this helped.","[The latest evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kraken/comments/1dv3myf/kraken_fees_on_leverage/) I can find says about .01% every 4 hours, adding to .04% a day, which would be about 14.6% a year.

Instead, look at what wall street does. The ETF’s for Bitcoin bought in around $32K/BTC and one bought in at $51K/BTC. It will likely never go below those numbers, because Wall Street understands how to play this game. You can research it yourself with financial data, not what a friend “thinks”.

Also, look at the world debt. Debt is our unrealized labor. The billionaires understand this. Someone has to pay that debt in labor, liquidity or assets. That’s why Trump has appointed billionaires to departmental heads. They’re going to milk the US economy, inflate the dollar, and create a gap between the rich and the poor.

So what side of the economic gap do you want to be on? You need assets that rise in value, whether it be a house, high end art, or something else that will hold value when the dollar plummets with tariffs.

Since we are at world war ii levels of debt, you can try to gauge how long it will take to pay that off. At least 15 years.

The time to yield production from all the printing is now! This next evolution needs to increase productivity to justify all the printing.

Paul Tudor Jones in a recent interview has said, no to fixed income, long gold, long Bitcoin and SHORTING THE BOND MARKET. Why though??

“Print our way out of inflation.” The deficit will most definitely increase the next coming years causing inflation to ramp up.

Inflation ramp up means short duration rates will follow to combat said inflation.

Why so confident in increasing the deficit, i.e. money printer go brrrrr?

Well, Bitcoin! Finally an asset that will be globally accessible much like US equities and debt instruments but in a much easier way for the individual. 

Money printer go brrrr, ramp up inflation, short duration yields are viable investments. Excess liquidity flows into stocks.

Excess liquidity driving already overvalued stocks you say? 

Enter Bitcoin, the asset ready to suck in $100 trillion dollars worth of capital thus supplanting itself as the ‘go to’ for long duration yields. 

TLT will turn to dust, nobody in their right mind will buy that shit. Nobody will buy long duration with BTC as an excess liquidity sponge and short duration yields continuously chasing inflation.

Let's say the house only went from 200 to 220k it still would have beaten the BTC dca in the same period.

Sure if BTC hits a million in a few years the story will be different, but you are mistaken about the past 4 years unless you timed the bottom or were a brilliant wave riding trader. No normal hold or dca in btc did as well as the average home purchase in the western world.",0,,,,reddit

Or we could just stay in tune with the normal routine and this cycle ends in QTR 4 of 2025 and crypto winter starts until the next halvening. 🤷🏼‍♂️

Genuine question. 

When do you guys think we can directly _spend_ bitcoin with less than 1% markup over fiat prices of the same items? 

By _spend_, I mean, buying coffee, doing online groceries, booking hotels etc. 

I live in Hong Kong, and a few merchants that do accept BTC want at least 7-8% markup if you want to pay by BTC. I mean, you can pay with foreign currencies (GBP, JPY) at many shops for less markup. 

I am not sure, but can only hope the situation is better elsewhere. Curious about the situation in the US. 

Can free market competition ever solve it?","Genuine question.

The collective wisdom was that there is a huge variation around the expectation value, and people genuinely had a wide variation of predictions about adoption of a new technology.  To me, this is pretty much the definition of risk.  As a consequence, the price of the asset is quite a bit lower because of the risk, and as the risk evaporates, the price converges to a long-term trend and volatility reduces.

So long before institutional money arrived via the BTC ETFs, El Salvador stuck its collective neck out and made a high risk/reward bet.

Noone in their right mind is going to spend an asset that grows in value like BTC. 
Once it becomes more stable and isn't giving the best returns anywhere then at that point the demand to be able to spend it might grow and with demand will come implementation of payment systems. 
Until then - it would be plain stupid thing that no-one wants and so won't happen I reckon.","Spend inflationatory currency. May as well shift those dollars on before they lose value.

2024-11-30,BTC,Bitcoin,comment,1h2we6c,lznav4d,t1_lzn3mpc,,"It affects the price by consuming a sell order from the book.

Let's say the last transaction was for 0.5 BTC at a price of $97,080. Because that was the last transaction that is now the price you see on a chart like TradingView.

Now suppose one of your friends wants to sell their BTC but that price is just a little bit too low. They can set up a limit order to say ""sell 0.25 BTC at $97,100"". Another friend also wants to sell but for a little bit more sp they put in a limit order of 0.25 at $97,200. Lastly a third friend add 0.5 BTC at $97,250. There are no other orders. So now we have an order book with a total of 1 BTC at 3 price points, but TradingView still says $97,080 because that was the **last** price.

Now you come along and you don't care about limit orders. You want to buy at the market, in other words what is being offered on the order book.

It makes sense for you to buy from your first friend because they are offering the cheapest rate, $97,100. And lets say you want to buy just 0.1 BTC. You submit your order and you exchange your USD for 0.1 BTC. Now that becomes the last transaction, so TradingView updates to $97,100. You affect the price on the chart bu making a transaction. All tradingview is doing is making a note of your trade and using the price you paid as the last price.

Since your first friend put it an order for 0.25 BTC and you only bought 0.1 BTC, their order is only partially filled and they still have 0.15 BTC on the order book at $97,100.

So now your brother wants to buy some BTC. Luckily because your first friend's order is still there they can buy at the same price you bought at. They buy 0.15 BTC at $97,100. Now your friends order is completely filled and it's removed from the order book. The cheapest sell order available now belongs to your second friend at $97,200 but what happens to TradingView? Well tradingview still says $97,100 because that was what your brother paid on the last transaction.

So this time your brother has affected the price of what's available from the order book by clearing the rest of that order, but he has not affected the price on the charts because he paid that same as you.

Now lets say your dad comes along and wants to buy, again using a market order. His transaction is for 0.25 BTC at $97,200. This new transaction causes tradingview to update once again to $97,200, but also he's cleared another order so the next person to make an order will be paying $97,250. Notice how there is a lag between what is on the order book, versis what is on the chart.

- transactions happen sequentially, one after the other
- charts like tradingview or google finance reflect the price of the last transaction, not the price available to the next trader
- charts do not show you how big the individual transaction was, just the price
- some charts can show the total quantity traded in a time frame, this is called volume
- the cheapest sell order determines the price for the next trader
- when all sell orders at one price are filled then the next trader after will have to buy at a new price
- traders selling at the market will sell to buy orders
- they will fill orders starting with the most expensive
- the difference between the cheapest sell order and most expensive buy order is called ""the spread""
- traders and market makers can add, remove or amend their orders at any time, therefore the order book itself can be constantly changing.

My example freezes the order book for several transactions to make it easier to understand the mechanics. In reality limit and market orders will be getting placed many times a second.

We can also assume the miners get lucky enough and the new fork we can all BTCX even gets listed on exchanges.

What happens next is people like me in the 99% who wanted old BTC decide to sell our coins on the BTCX chain. Pretty soon instead of trading anywhere near the 95k BTC is currently at it falls, as the 1% interested in this chain can't sustain that ptice in the face of the 99% selling AND double the sell pressure of new coins from the miners on that chain.

Once it falls under a quarter of the original BTC 95K price the 50% miners are now making less than before even though they're mining twice as many nominal units. They can either continue mining at a loss, or switch back to mining the original BTC chain.

We already lived through this with bitcoin cash - some of those guys chose to pay me up to 3k for my coins on the bitcoin cash fork and now the trade for 500, while the bitcoin I bought from them is much higher.

There is a financial cost to supporting a minority chain, which is why it doesn't happen, not because miners are just deciding to turn down money hey could otherwise have.","Lets imagine the case where miners decide to double the issuance per block from the current 3.125 back up to 6.25. Lets says, for whaever reason 1% of bitcoin users are on board with this but 99% are not and we get a fork.

We can also assume the miners get lucky enough and the new fork we can all BTCX even gets listed on exchanges.

What happens next is people like me in the 99% who wanted old BTC decide to sell our coins on the BTCX chain.

Around this time last year bitcoin was trading at about $16k. Did you make it?

I'm a relative newbie; school of late 2021 and got in just before that year's ATH. I bought all the way down the slope for the next two years and even aquired some filthy shitcoins along the way.

It was pretty tough to keep finding the conviction to DCA more cash when every month bitcoin would drop again. I'd go in my garage, pump iron and [listen to some more Saylor](https://www.youtube.com/@Cryptomemeinspiration) on my headphones (and usually end up  smash-buying some more!)

I read 'The Bitcoin Standard' again, I understood it better.

I converted my shitcoins to bitcoin fairly early on and I'm so glad I took a bit of a hit on them back then.

I read Vijay Boyapati's '[The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-part-1-of-4-94087a70d9e8)' again I understood it better.

I read Yan Pritzker's 'Inventing Bitcoin', I understood it better.

I read Gigi's '[21 Lessons](https://21lessons.com/)', I understood it better.

I read a load of older stuff including 'The Fourth Turning', 'The Creature from Jekyll Island', 'The Soverign Individual' and 'Atlas Shrugged'.

Yeah, I went full regard and clearly there's a lot of bias here in my choices but something in each of these books was resonating with me and solidifying my view on how money works. The more I read the more I felt I was definitely on the right road. This knowledge has become my own personal proof-of-work. The bear market, far from being bad gave me time to learn from some really great authors.

If you're a long term HODLer, dude, I take my hat off to you. It's a lonely time and not easy. But those dark days in the garage lifting weights and being down 70% punched me in the face and taught me the true meaning of what a long time preference really is.

Next challenge: HODLing through the bull market. Good luck.","Around this time last year bitcoin was trading at about $16k. Did you make it?

Stocks and bonds are purchased for their returns. The average person needs compound interest to build retirement portfolios and companies need reliable ways to raise capital.  Bitcoin is not an alternative to these functions. Markets will still have a demand for stocks and bonds.

The current Bitcoin investment returns are because the market is still speculating on Bitcoins growth. We're assuming more people will adopt Bitcoin.

I never had much of a green thumb.

I would get distracted, and forget to water.

I could never pick the right days to plant or furrow.  And so I never got to harvest.

One day I found a seed.  Nobody around me recognized that it was a seed, but I did.

I examined it closely.  It was a seed I could grow!  A seed for me.  A special seed, fundamentally different from other seeds, but a seed none-the-less.

It seemed to me like it could grow forever, and I could live off its fruits.  I almost doubted my imagination.  I had to be careful.

I kept it close.  It didn't matter when I planted it.  It began to grow in the obscurity of my garden.

It didn't need my help.  I did nothing.  Like Siddhartha, I waited, I fasted, and I thought.

I waited long, never leaning on the sprout, barely looking at the rising shoot.

I didn't understand it fully.  I had no schemes to hasten its ascent.  I did not trust myself not to make a mistake.  I trusted myself that choosing not to act was best.  And I waited.

Some time later, my attentions and energies spent elsewhere, I returned to my garden and began living off the fruit.

There is no bad time to plant a tree.","I never had much of a green thumb.

Way back in the day I was idiotically scammed on there and released some BTC I shouldn't have. At the time I reported the scammer but never attempted to recover my BTC as I assumed it would be too hard to trace. I've since learned how traceable bitcoin really is and if you combine that with how stupid the average scammer is he or someone he sent the BTC to would have slipped up by now and it could be linked to a real person. Anyway, I want to request all my account and transaction info for that trade from localbitcoins. As a Finnish company they are legally required to hold onto all identifiable information related to accounts that trade with them for a minimum of 5 years after the end of the account. Due to when my account closed they are legally required to have at least my data surrounding that trade, or possibly the scammers data too if he didn't close his account at least 5 years ago. I've filed a support ticket and I had an auto-confirm message, but it's been a while and I doubt anyone actually mans the support anymore. Has anyone been in touch with localbtc lately or know a way to get in touch with someone attached to the company?

Also I've seen posts on this sub relating to scams before and I'm not remotely interested in replies blaming me for the loss, saying I have no chance of getting my BTC back or anything else that doesn't directly answer the question of how to contact localbtc.","Way back in the day I was idiotically scammed on there and released some BTC I shouldn't have.

I've filed a support ticket and I had an auto-confirm message, but it's been a while and I doubt anyone actually mans the support anymore. Has anyone been in touch with localbtc lately or know a way to get in touch with someone attached to the company?

Also I've seen posts on this sub relating to scams before and I'm not remotely interested in replies blaming me for the loss, saying I have no chance of getting my BTC back or anything else that doesn't directly answer the question of how to contact localbtc.

2024-11-28,BTC,investing,comment,1h1ifzp,lzez0js,t3_1h1ifzp,,"Bitcoin works as money because it is:

- Scarce, there is a finite amount of 21,000,000. 

- Divisible, each bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 subunits. 

- Salable, you can easily transfer it to someone else for goods or services.

- Transferable, you can send it to anyone, anywhere, at any time, instantly.

People “want dollars” only in the sense that the US dollar has more people currently willing to accept it. But as a money, the US dollar is objectively worse.

It has a completely infinite and arbitrary supply, which means that its use as a long term store of value is completely worthless.

And outside of physical cash transactions do not settle for almost a month, if you sell me something I can reverse the charge even if you have already fulfilled your end of the bargain and there’s nothing you can do about it. Conversely, Bitcoin transactions are fully settled in as little as ten minutes and at most a few hours.

But you’re completely right that basically every crypto bro meme token is hot air. Bitcoin is, at this time, unique.","Bitcoin works as money because it is:

We have a sense of superiority because we ARE superior.  We maximalists have correctly concluded the money almost everyone uses is corrupted and inferior and we have built a better money that cannot be stolen via seigniorage.  We ARE in fact superior.  You may not like this truth, but it is truth nonetheless.

>I see a lot of people asking questions and the responses are ridiculous.

I think I am one of the most toxic of the maximalists populi, but I have patiently explained money to many people I deem sincere and worthy.  What we do not like are the dumbasses walking in here spouting nonsense and asking dumb questions that reveal they have NOT EVEN BOTHERED to think critically about money for even or put any effort into doing so.  Fuck these people.  They should have been asking questions about dollars and eurors and gold long before they come seeking wisdom from us wise men of Bitcoin.

Fiat is already ""crypto"" , you need to be much more specific when you ask this question. 

>But if so wouldn't that mean that they couldn't adopt bitcoin either for the same reasons?

Countries are already adopting Bitcoin . El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender and is buying 1 btc a day and Trump Just said he will at least make the 208,109 btc held by the USA a reserve asset that they will not auction off and other senators are proposing to buy 200k btc a year.

If you are asking about a CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) than it might adopt a ""blockchain"" data structure but this will not give it any benefits besides ""marketing"" for rebranding of a fiat currency. 

Blockchain's without proof of work are pointless from a technical perspective. 

So would a state create its own competing decentralized PoW coin to compete with Bitcoin and Bitcoin properties? What do you think?","> So they won't make a **crypto** because it would be inefficient and they would lose alot of control over their currency?

2024-11-12,BTC,Bitcoin,comment,1gowxx2,lwpukmr,t3_1gowxx2,,"“ it’s still not widely used in daily transactions, whether it’s for groceries, utilities, or other routine purchases.”

The phrase “If you judge a fish on its ability to climb trees…” is fitting here. Bitcoin is not a simple concept, so it is not clear why it continues to be so successful without looking into what it can and what it can’t do.

Bitcoin will absolutely never be used for day to day purchases *on-chain* (i.e on the blockchain itself), because it isn’t possible to process this many transactions without fatally compromising network decentralisation and network security. The limit for number of transactions per year on bitcoin is about 100 million. You can bolt on second and third layer profiles on top of the bitcoin network- lightning is one example, but it remains to be seen if this will be widely used.

Why does anyone need the insane security of an on-chain bitcoin transaction for buying groceries? It’s not the problem bitcoin was built to solve, because that isn’t a problem that needs solving - Using trusted 3rd parties for minor purchases is generally fine and low risk.

Bitcoin does a couple of things very well - It creates money that central authorities and governments cannot print out of thin air, and money that can be moved anywhere without any permission from anyone. That’s about it. These are two properties that no modern money has. 

And because of these properties, bitcoin settles more value than visa and mastercard combined. That isn’t speculation, this is legitimate network activity that is happening and people are paying for the privilege of right now.

Bitcoins unrelenting emphasis on decentralisation and network security means it cannot handle a huge number of transactions on its base layer. That doesn’t mean that a large number of people don’t find its base later very useful, and it doesn’t mean people can’t build other features on top of the bitcoin network. It is an attempt to fix money from its foundation.

It is *already* bigger than you can imagine, consuming ~0.5% of global electricity production and settling trillions per annum in a way that ensures such transactions can never be reversed. 

The questions become - given bitcoin’s unique properties, will it be more useful to a wider group of people in future? Can the properties that makes bitcoin successful be replicated by anything else, or will these properties erode over time?","“ it’s still not widely used in daily transactions, whether it’s for groceries, utilities, or other routine purchases.”

First, Indonesia being a Muslim country means their interest rates on credit and debt are absurdly low compared to western finance. 

Second, while Indonesia is doing okay economically there still is a big separation in wealth for most of the population. Getting designer clothes, Haggen-dazs, foreign perfumes, etc, are all similar in price to other countries, but local foods and rent are extremely cheap. So being in the poverty class means you can afford food and shelter pretty easily, but you might not be able to keep up with the Jones's in a lot of ways.  

Third, Indonesia's rupiah currency also has had a history of bad inflation, and continues to lose parity with USD even if their inflation within their country is not too high. 

All of this is to say that you can't take a US-based mindset of how to build wealth and uniformly apply it to Indonesians, especially when their own currency has wildly different applications in day to day life than what Americans and other countries might experience. 

A Bitcoin standard as a means of investment is definitely more beneficial for them.","I do enjoy some of the 'privileged' mindset here.

The other is the fact that it’s a store of value; which is especially important because the US is very likely to continue printing money to no end and destroy the value of USD further. Trump certainly won’t help.

So I've been learning about Bitcoin since 2014 when I was first introduced to a friend mining BTC in his closet using Raspberry Pi's. In 2021, I got involved with very little. As Bitcoin has grown over the years, and with people waking up to its value, I am starting to notice some potential problems. And I'd like experts in this subreddit to help me understand them better. Here's the first problem I've noticed recently. Let's say Person A has been DCA bitcoin for the past 4 years on Coinbase. That's thousands of transactions. And now they are hearing they should put everything in a cold wallet. When they go to research how, they discover that there could be uTXO issues, and figure out a way to avoid fees, or worse, encounter a problem where their cold wallet completing the transfer. Let's assume that Bitcoin is adopted globally over the next few years, starting with the United States in 2025 with a federal reserve. What's going to happen to all of these people who invest in Bitcoin, but don't have the mental capacity to figure out how to transfer it to a cold wallet, let alone deal with uTXO issues. The comparison I can make with this is older people (when the Internet first came out) having a hard time understand how to use it. Or recently, older people having a hard time figuring out how to use basic technology, like an iPhone, or social media. Do you see this being a huge problem? And if there's an easy way to someone to transfer their BTC from an exchange to a cold wallet, granted it's thousands of individual purchases from DCA, has that solution been created and offered to the public? One of the biggest problems I see if that for the average joe is understanding Bitcoin and the Blockchain.... what it does, its use cases, etc... For most, it's like trying to teach a monkey sign lanuage. Sure, it's possible, but it's going to take forever. Why isn't the messaging behind Bitcoin, the blockahin, DePIN, Web3.0, and all the other stuff emerging explained differently. All of these things should be advertised so easy that a caveman could understand. That would make for easier global acceptance. Am I making sense here? Clearly I'm one of these people struggling. But I am trying.","So I've been learning about Bitcoin since 2014 when I was first introduced to a friend mining BTC in his closet using Raspberry Pi's. In 2021, I got involved with very little.

My defence here is that there haven't been any new arguments in a while.",1,,,,reddit

2024-11-09,BTC,Bitcoin,post,1gngmec,,,Question: Why would a bank decide to not lend someone money?,"Question: Why would a bank decide to not lend someone money?
Given that banks create deposits (ie money) when someone takes out a loan with them, what is the incentive for a bank to refuse to loan money to anyone?

Take this scenario as an example:

1. Alice goes to the Bank for a loan. Alice wants to start a TV station that shows exclusively experimental art. She wants $10 million.
2. The Bank decides to give the loan to her. They create a $10 million account and give it to her. They record her loan contract at 1%/year interest as the asset that ""backs"" that money.
3. Alice then goes and starts that TV station. It quickly fails and she's out the entire $10 million and files for bankrupcy. No interest or principle has been paid. 
4. What happens to the bank?

In that case, that created money is already out there in the wild, paid to whoever by Alice. The money supply has increased. But as far as I can tell, the bank is just as well off as it was before Alice requested the loan. Even tho no interest was paid, nothing was lost.

The only way I can see that a bank would be worse off for this failing of risk evaluation is if they were required to destroy $10 million of their own money upon the end of that loan contract, regardless of whether it ended because of repayment or because of bankrupcy. In that case, $10 million of their money would be destroyed and they'd be out that much. I have to imagine that's what's going on, and I'm pretty sure that's what happens in the case of repayment, but I haven't thought about what happens in the bankrupcy case.","Given that banks create deposits (ie money) when someone takes out a loan with them, what is the incentive for a bank to refuse to loan money to anyone?

Bitcoin isn't just money it literally is technology. Before Bitcoin we had no way to store property digitally. Bitcoin is immutable and doesn't care about anything but it's code anybody in this world can utilize Bitcoins technology and not have to succumb to their government or not having the credentials to send funds. It is the largest fastest growing Network in the world it is also the most decentralized Network you really can't put a price tag on that. If I was some King and I wanted to send a trillion dollars overseas it would take a shit ton of resources time and energy and at the same time we might be robbed on the way or be sucked into a whirlpool.

In mid-2022, I bought 11 BTC at \~$20.5K for **$225,000.**

A few days ago, I sold my entire portfolio for **$1,002,000.**

The transfer from Coinbase to my BofA account hit today, so I decided to make this post.

Do I think Bitcoin will hit $100K this year? Yes.

Do I think it will continue its run in 2025? Yes.

But am I gonna try to time the top? No.

I'd much rather secure a guaranteed $1 million at this age than risk losing it by trying to time the market.

I sold when BTC was $91K, and as I'm writing this it's sitting at $93K. So far I have missed out on *\*some\** gains... and I'm sure I'll miss out on much more as the months go by. And that's okay with me.

I hope everyone reading this KILLS IT during this bull market!

P.S. For those who will inevitably ask *""So how'd you get $225K at 22 years old then? Daddy's money?""* The answer is no. I've been trying to launch dozens of businesses since I was 14. Some worked, most failed. So that money was basically my life savings from 14-22 haha.

A co-worker introduced me to crypto back in the final quarter of 2021. I started buying some meme coins and everything seemed good, I was actually gaining some profit out of them at the time. Lost total faith in  shit coins as I ended up all negative after the pandemic. 
For bitcoin I thought it would just keep droping and never get back to how it was before the pandemic, and if it did it would take a century to recover.  
If I have had invested the $10,000 I would  already had cashed out at the current $90,000, pay off my mortage be debt free, keep working and saving and maybe buy bitcoin again at the next drop.
Despite many are expecting bitcoin could reach $100k - $120k, I don't think its the right time to buy bitcoin, the things happening around the world speak by themselves,  it seems another  drop is going to happen soon  and looks its going to be huge.

2024-11-17,BTC,wallstreetbets,comment,1gt4xgw,lxl83p4,t1_lxkznzn,,"> So it all comes to a grinding end when the supply of bitcoin goes dry? If the idea is to just hoard, hoard, hoard how will this make it work? Once they own all the bit coin, minus the coins lost? what happens? I probably won't live to see that day (maybe) OR something else comes along? They call them black swan events, because no one sees them coming, not even those claiming they found the so called ""Holy Grail"" to wealth preservation.

Ok, I get that this is confusing.  First, the supply will never go dry.  There will always be some willing sellers, just like in every market.  The reason the price goes up is because that's what it takes to find a willing seller, just like when the price of something goes down it's searching for a willing buyer.  If you can imagine the absurdity of one person with the last bitcoin and Microstrategy wants to buy it off them, what price do you think the person could command for it?  Practically infinity, right?  So work your way back from there and understand that MSTR owns about 1.2% of the bitcoin right now.  What would it take for them to get to just 2%?  Absolutely bananas amounts of money.  It gets exponentially harder to acquire more.  Especially with all the other people and entities out there endlessly acquiring, like Blackrock.

It is confusing that they just hoard because it's not what most companies do.  Most companies do share buybacks or dividends or M&A or a whole bunch of things that decapitalise the company.  They are doing something different to normal and they do explain why if you care to find out.  Your question goes to some philosophical concepts about what is money.  It's very hard to give a simple answer that helps explain this, but I'd just start with saying when you go to work and earn money yo do that to buy other goods and services you want in the future, sometimes soon sometimes months later, maybe a house or a car.  You need to exchange your labour for something that preserves its value.  That's high interest savings accounts, IRAs, investing in the stock market, housing, art, gold and for some people it's bitcoin.

MSTR is becoming a company that straddles both the traditional world of finance and bitcoin.  Many parts of the traditional world of finance seem to want exposure to bitcoin for whatever reasons.  That's one of the main drivers of the bitcoin ETFs, right?  So MSTR is offering similar but different products by way of bitcoin bonds.  The reason their stock has gone up so much is because they are a bitcoin holding company for other interested parties, just like the ETFs.  But, different financial products, different rules etc.

Does anyone need that money if they are already a billionaire?  That is again philosophical and also a bit funny to read on a place like wallstreetbets.  It goes to the question of what is capitalism and is it good or bad.  I don't have to like capitalism to see that this is how the world works, and those with the capital make the rules for how it continues to work.  You can fight it, maybe it's even a noble fight, idk.

2024-11-23,BTC,Bitcoin,post,1gxtfth,,,My Accidental Bitcoin Journey Ended Tonight,"My Accidental Bitcoin Journey Ended Tonight
I originally bought my first Bitcoins in 2012, while living in Europe, as a means for buying substances of ill repute.  At any given time, I had several of them in an online wallet (don’t even remember where). I eventually stopped partying so much, but still had 3-4 laying around.  By the time I moved back to the US in 2015, I remembered the wallet and was shocked to see that what was originally maybe $50 worth of coins had turned into something like $1500. I didn’t understand it, but that is when I started reading more about it.  I would talk about it with friends and try to convince them to buy.  I eventually built my stack up to about 7 bitcoins by late 2017. As the price soared, I kept imagining my life as a millionaire.  When the crash happened, I forgot all about its cyclic nature and panicked, selling 4 of them around the $7K mark.  I invested that $30K and left the 3 remaining bitcoins in my wallet.  And they stayed there for 6 more years.  In 2023, I sold another one for about $25K to help pay for my wedding. At that point I vowed to not sell my last 2 until it mooned.  Today, my wife and I did something we never thought possible - we made an offer on an investment property.  It was accepted tonight and I sold my last two remaining bitcoins, for just shy of $200K so that I had the funds for a down payment.

Maybe I played the game horribly.  Maybe I would have $700K worth of bitcoin if I stuck to my original plan of keeping 7 bitcoins.  I don’t know. Feels pretty good to turn a pretty small investment into a 25% down payment on an investment property though.

I’ll continue to occasionally buy bitcoin after this, but I recognize that I may never afford to ever get close to owning 1 BTC ever again, let alone multiple.  But I’m ok with it.  I got a debt-free wedding and an investment property out of it.  I’m happy.

Just a little story to say that it’s ok to use your bitcoin to fund your life along the way.  It’s likely part of the journey.  Be well.","I originally bought my first Bitcoins in 2012, while living in Europe, as a means for buying substances of ill repute.

Isn't that concerning? It makes sense but how likely is it?

Quote:
""Schiff theorized that if the U.S. were to purchase 1 million Bitcoins, such a large purchase would send Bitcoin prices to unprecedented highs. According to Schiff, this would prompt existing Bitcoin holders, currently worth “millions or billions,” to cash out their holdings, setting off a destabilizing cycle in which Bitcoin prices would plummet and the U.S. government would be forced to step in to buy more Bitcoins to stabilize the market.

“To keep the price from falling, the US will have to print more dollars to keep buying Bitcoin,” Schiff said. He predicted that this constant buying would devalue the dollar and lead to an inflationary spiral that could destroy the currency’s purchasing power. “A reserve of something that you can never sell and have to constantly buy is worthless as a reserve,” Schiff warned, adding that such a policy would likely trigger hyperinflation and render the dollar “completely worthless.”","Isn't that concerning?

I'm sure there are lots of posts like mine that are popping up right now, so forgive me in advance. I made my first BTC investment (using Coinbase) the morning after the election. Right now, I'm at about .145 of a coin, going to invest more in next few days to get up to at least 0.25 of 1 coin. 

Based on the research I've done so far (and I have much more in front of me), the next likely crash is in 2026, with 2025 being hopefully a great year for growth. Of course, past performance is never a guarantee of future results. I know it's impossible to time the market. 

Wondering what any of you guys would do in my situation? I'm trying to not dip into my 1-year safety fund, and of course won't be touching my 401K (which is all in S&P 500, index mutual funds, and doing quite well). Within the next 2 months or so, I will have around 30K ish more to invest. I'm not sure if I should throw it all into BTC, or just DCA BTC and maybe open up another brokerage account and do single names? 

I'm looking at doing a master suite on my house in the next 2-3 years, so hoping BTC will (in part, at least) help me achieve that goal (will cost 150-200K most likely). 

I'd like to increase my position as fast as possible, but also don't want to go too crazy. Curious to hear others' thoughts. Thanks all! Please pardon the newbie post lol.","I'm sure there are lots of posts like mine that are popping up right now, so forgive me in advance.

This bull run really started BEFORE the halving with the ETF launch.

Now we have:
- ETFs - making it easier for normal people to buy
- Derivatives - access to massive capital markets and ability for big players to hedge positions (giving them the confidence to work with this asset)
- companies, pension funds adding it as a treasury asset
- US states adding it to their treasury
- nation states adding it to their strategic reserves - read that again… nation states. All wanting to acquire a scarce resource. Game theory at geopolitical scales!

The enormous wall of money that is moving in to Bitcoin over the next 12 months is almost impossible to imagine. 

Looking at it rationally - I believe this time WILL be different.

There will still be dips and pull backs I’m sure. But we still have a long way to run (up) in this wave and we may never dip back to these prices again.

I want you guys to take very seriously what I’m about to say

Right now there’s a gold rush 2.0 happening with bitcoin. And there will be a period where bitcoin is so expensive and scarce that people who are aware of your bag will soon go from ignoring you/thinking your weird and annoying, to envying what you have because of their missed opportunity. 

People will come out of the wood works to demand things of you based off the newfound wealth you have that’s truly yours. Whether it be family, strangers, or a tyrannical government. What’s happening now is not unusual to similar events in history. It’s human nature and it will happen even if you don’t think so. 

Lastly, you must kill any ideas that you don’t believe any of this will happen and that you don’t deserve wealth, freedom, and choice in this world. 99% of people will never truly understand what that really is nor really care to achieve it. And that’s mostly due to the idea that it’s so far out the realm of reality for them that it’s not possible. 

Further, it’s also the imposter syndrome that they don’t deserve it because it was money made by literally doing nothing. That we’ve been told you have to slave away at a job for decades to achieve just a semblance of it. But that’s not true. You work a job and have had to make the necessary sacrifices to get to 1 BTC. Cut vacation time, dinner dates, buying something you really want etc. Because the results that await, with delayed gratification,  are things that would not have otherwise happened had you maintained your course. You have the ability to change that, now. I wouldn’t say this if I personally didn’t feel this way myself","I want you guys to take very seriously what I’m about to say

If you truly understood Bitcoin; you would be all in too. Decentralized.Planetary.Internet.Medium of Exchange. Spawned from the gods or simulators. Some open source code and a couple of computers and the network is created. Drop that idea on a forum online and suddenly you have the fastest and strongest computing network planet earth has ever seen. 

People have been around for thousands of years and haven't figured out a way to exchange value with one another, efficiently. From seashells to golden coins, counterfeits and corrupt misfits. Across every line in the sand we use another currency. Hundreds of them, all fighting for the global reserve. At the hands of the elite the monopoly gods set the tone on the streets. They sell you paper money, take your paper money, then spend your paper money. 

They say we have to use it. But what if we don't. We use the hardest asset ever created. Fairly distributed on a first come first serve basis. Mine every coin using electricity. A phenomenon humanity will always use. Power and protect the network with said electricity. Use the internet to move the coins. Genius. A monatary black hole that swallows up every currency and market on earth. The elites hate it. They can't stop it. They try, but the people have spoken. If you can't beat them, join them. And they did. 

If you think you are late to bitcoin at 1.6 trillion. Wait till it swallows a quadrillion. That would be late.","Happy 100k

2024-11-19,BTC,Bitcoin,post,1guujjh,,,We need to start running more nodes ASAP!,"We need to start running more nodes ASAP!
I'm thinking about two doomsday scenarios can't decide which one is worse. But I know one thing both of them can be prevented just by running more nodes and securing them. Let me explain the two doomsday scenarios:

# Doomsday Threat 1: Operation Olympic Games

In 2006 the US and Israel started the project which was a cyber attack operation inside an only 1MB flash drive. It could infect any device that it had any sort of connection and it was nearly impossible to detect because it did literally nothing. Until one day when the virus reached to its main target which was Iran's nuclear centrifuge (which is isolated from the internet). After reaching it (and 58% of all of the devices) the virus started running and destroyed the facility just by adjusting the speed of the centrifuges.

My point is there are currently only 19k nodes running. If a government or an organization big enough wanted to destroy Bitcoin infrastructure they could simultaneously shut down all the nodes or maybe alter those nodes the make changes on Bitcoin. And we would not know they were in charge the whole time because this 1MB (only 1 MB) virus does nothing prior to the main attack.

# Doomsday Threat 2: Outnumbering the Opponent

As I said currently there are only 19k running nodes which can be easily outnumbered again if a government or an organization big enough wanted to. Hear me out, if they were to run their own 20k nodes they would get the number advantage, thus they could release the updates they want to. And even they could alter the blocks. If you think about it you will realise that corporations and governments hold the majority of the available Bitcoins which means on top of that if they were to run the majority of the nodes, we would be doomed.

# Ultimate Solution: Just Running More Nodes and Starting ASAP

That's it. We just need to run more and more nodes. If you truly believe in Bitcoin and have a recognizable amount of it that you don't want to lose, then you also have to contribute to the system's security. Running a node is just easy as setting up a wallet. Plus, you get to have more privacy since you will be making transactions from your own node which is pretty cool.



**TL;DR:** We have to start running more nodes to prevent disasters that are inevitable otherwise!","I'm thinking about two doomsday scenarios can't decide which one is worse.

I travelled in Egypt, Jordan and Israel about a decade ago. In Egypt, the salary for a normal person was roughly $40 per MONTH. At least that's what I was told. That would give you 2500 months to live (or 208 years)


I spent 1 night at a hotel in Dahab for 1.5 USD. A meal could easily be bought for a similar price. The hotel was shitty, and the rest of my stay I spent between 3 and 15 bucks depending on the area and level of service. I am just giving examples here.

I know things have changed. And I know that (apparently from what I see in tve comments) people wanting to live 'comfortably' means having a yacht or something.
For me, living comfortably would mean having enough for a place to sleep and buy groceries without having to work.

That's actually not just 'comfortably' or the life of a 'peasant'. That's oligarch shjt. But hey, I grew up Euro-poor, so apparantly my standard is lower (or less spoiled).

This is not an attack on you, but a lash out at the other commenters.
Additionally, I used anecdotal evidence, but I am sure there are more countries around the world where you can live cheaper (probably in Africa or Asia)","Ah I see, I read the comments and got the sceptical vibes, apologies.

I travelled in Egypt, Jordan and Israel about a decade ago. In Egypt, the salary for a normal person was roughly $40 per MONTH. At least that's what I was told. That would give you 2500 months to live (or 208 years)


I spent 1 night at a hotel in Dahab for 1.5 USD. A meal could easily be bought for a similar price. The hotel was shitty, and the rest of my stay I spent between 3 and 15 bucks depending on the area and level of service. I am just giving examples here.

Rent is a consistent stream of income that will eventually pay for the entire property. Lets say your rent is 1/100 of your overall home price, so it takes roughly 8 years to recoup your buy in. Plus you can now sell the property for close to double what you paid.

Especially now with big players catching some btc they might sell some since its already 500% up in 2 years. Mind that they also want price to be at a discount",1,,,,reddit

Most of yall don’t even know that Cede and Company probably owns your stocks and you don’t even own them. If they ever wanna take your shit they can. 🤣 

Bitcoin is everything gold couldn’t be. Bitcoin is everything Fiat couldn’t be. Gold is decentralized but you can’t carry around gold easily at all. Fiat is easily carried but is centralized and essentially worthless. It’s also used to suppress the price of gold and silver. 

Bitcoin is both easily transported and decentralized. It’s not an “investment”. It is digital gold. Gold but better.

The question is what will be the next “USD”? Your dollar won’t last. No fiat does. The average lifespan of fiat money is very short. 

You trade stocks owned by someone who isn’t you. You use a bank that can control what you do with your money and can shut down. And you transact in a dollar that just gets printed and put into the hands of blackrock. And your government shorts silver and gold to the extreme. Do you really believe silver, the most valuable material in this technology era, is only worth 30 bucks? We’ve been in a silver deficit for years now too. But you question the legitimacy of bitcoin. A decentralized network money system. Your bitcoin can’t be controlled/taken by anyone and is more secure than a bank account.

2) what period of time do you DCA over

1 is more important. A couple things to note, on average, lump sum, as soon as possible is the best strategy. But it comes with the risk of emotional hurt if there is a large drop in price.

So for #1 do some thought experiments. Imagine allocating 50% to lump sum and 50% to dca. How would you feel given the following circumstances:
1) bitcoin trades sideways
2) bitcoin drops for a period of time (before going back up)
3) bitcoin drops for a long time (unlikely IMO)
4) bitcoin shoots up rapidly and never comes down

Mark down which scenario you would feel the most regret and rate it on a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being no regret, to 5 being the worst of thoughts). Then do the same activity allocating 100% to bitcoin and then with 100% to DCA. Pick the strategy with the worst possible regret being the lowest. You can toy around with the percentages too.

Then move on to decision #2. You could do the same exercise as above but I think this decision matters a lot less. You probably want to think about it in terms of when the next super-cycle will peak: january, April, July, 2026, after that would be rather atypical.

Best of luck.","If this is real. You basically have two separate decisions:

This isn't a party thing, both sides elected and reelected more pro-Bitcoin politicians this cycle than ever before. I keep preaching this on other subs where most people are ignorant that Bitcoiners won. 

Senate is majority pro-Bitcoin. The Treasury Committee is pro-Bitcoin. Last I checked Congress is majority pro-Bitcoin with 292 members. The administration picks are MOSTLY pro-Bitcoiners and owners/hodlers of Bitcoin. 

Besides this being the first time the government has this much support it is also WAY beyond the support we have ever seen before. The anti-crypto army trying to make Bitcoin private addresses illegal is gone. Pro-CBDC politicians have been gutted and lost power. Whether you like it or not Bitcoin and crypto will start seeing biased regulation and legal tsunamis in their favor, a complete 180 from the last 4 years. 

My hopium is too high for the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill passing when every level of government supports the bill. Anyone have any criticisms or concerns about the Bill? I'd love to hear them.

2024-11-10,BTC,Bitcoin,post,1goa31i,,,Can anyone explain what happened in this transaction? ,"Can anyone explain what happened in this transaction? 
context:

A few years ago, two friends and I decided to invest in Bitcoin together. Two of us transferred fiat currency to a third friend, who used it to buy the Bitcoins from an exchange and store them all in a single wallet. From there, he transferred our shares into individual Ledger sub-wallets marked with our names (see image of transaction). Later, when I acquired my own cold wallet, this friend transferred my share to it.

Now, three years later, I’ve discovered that 0.125 BTC appears to be missing from that transaction. When I asked my friend about it, he assured me that he transferred my entire share and has no idea what might have happened to the rest. And that seems to be where the conversation ends.

I’m feeling a bit stuck since 0.125 BTC is a considerable amount to have gone missing. I’ve checked all previous transactions and found this discrepancy, but I haven’t been able to determine where the missing 0.125 BTC could have gone. Has anyone experienced something similar, or does anyone have any insights into where it might be?","context:

USDC relies on Circle/Coinbase - a single company that can freeze funds or be pressured by governments. We've seen this happen with other stablecoins. BTC's decentralization means no single entity can stop transactions.

That said, you're absolutely right that for pure value preservation, USDC could work just as well as BTC if you can access it. Both beat watching your savings evaporate in a failing local currency.

BTC just happens to have more established peer-to-peer networks in many of these regions since it's been around longer. You can walk into local shops to trade BTC for cash in many neighborhoods - that infrastructure took years to build. USDC could develop similar networks over time.

The key is having options when your currency fails. Both tools can help, they just have different tradeoffs.

BTC has also historically gone up over time, even if there are dips (that are pretty cyclical and predictable, within a few months) holding Bitcoin long term and not trying to time the market has been shown to yield gains.

It isn’t though. Yeah it’s technically true that I can send bitcoin to anyone around the world. But neither one of us can actually buy things we need with it. Walmart doesn’t accept bitcoin. No grocery store I’m aware of does either. My mortgage company or apartment complex would laugh me out of the office if I asked to pay in bitcoin.

So at best bitcoin is just an obfuscation layer. I can buy and sell illegal stuff without revealing my identity. But that’s it. And even then it’s risky. If I want to buy actual non-illegal luxury goods then I still have to go to a bank and convert my bitcoin to usd, so the irs is gonna catch on.

>Bitcoin's value is because inherently in the fact that enough people have agreed it is valuable

Half truth. The whole point being made in here is that the “agreed upon value” is 90% FOMO. People don’t agree that bitcoin is inherently worth tens of thousands for a single coin. They agree that they think enough suckers still exist willing to buy a single coin for that price. In other words most people are just hoarding it like a stock because they think it’s still gonna go up. The vast majority of bitcoin in existence is not regularly spent. ","Found the triggered crypto bro lol

>The fact that it is recognised and accepted around the world without any centralisation is its inherent value.

In other words, fiat inflation may end up being Bitcoin's steady-state APY at some point in the future - when all of the early investor, risk-based growth is tapped out.

This implies Bitcoin's current APY is the reward for taking the risk of betting your fiat value on it before there is wide-spread consensus on Bitcoin's staying power and intrinsic value. Under this thesis, that reward is temporary (it only exists while there isn't consensus regarding Bitcoin as a store of value).","The only case I can think of these days is that, in the long run (who knows how long from now), Bitcoin's market cap can grow so large such that its volatility shrinks drastically, and its year over year fiat value only tracks the true inflation rate of which ever country has the number one fiat currency at that time.

That's true, I have no debt, I ""owe""(!) nothing to anybody. Not even on my house, which I was able to purchase without any loan also thanks to bitcoin.

> probably sold at 20k dip

No, I sold the vast majority already 2015 at the dip around 150-200 USD at only around 1000-2000% gain relative to my avg. purchasing price. This teached me a lesson to never sell too early again, and only think in terms of real value, never in terms of nominal fiat valuations. I also sold some BTC near the 2017 ATH at around 15k and hodled the rest ever since.

Whether my statements above are true or fictional I leave to everyone's personal beliefs. Of course I herewith declare that I made this all up, because nobody should publicly disclose one's own holdings.

I guess most people here started purchasing rather late, i.e. when BTC already had 3- or 4- or 5- digit valuations in USD (for reasons I am not aware of, since the facts were lying on the table openly since 2009, so why did these people wait another 5 to 10 years before buying BTC?). That's why they are so sensitive and nervous now when reading the truth, I suppose.

These people are needy. So they tell themselves that their investment is more in the green than what is actually is, by measuring it in units of highly inflationary devalued US Dollars.","> Bet he owes 0

Whether my statements above are true or fictional I leave to everyone's personal beliefs. Of course I herewith declare that I made this all up, because nobody should publicly disclose one's own holdings.

I guess most people here started purchasing rather late, i.e. when BTC already had 3- or 4- or 5- digit valuations in USD (for reasons I am not aware of, since the facts were lying on the table openly since 2009, so why did these people wait another 5 to 10 years before buying BTC?). That's why they are so sensitive and nervous now when reading the truth, I suppose.

These people are needy. So they tell themselves that their investment is more in the green than what is actually is, by measuring it in units of highly inflationary devalued US Dollars.",3,,,,reddit

2024-11-28,BTC,investing,comment,1h1ifzp,lzhhg01,t1_lzgmaum,,"There are 2 main reasons:

1. In PoS protocols, the censorship threshold usually kicks in much earlier than the safety threshold, so PoS blockchains will halt before any reorgs can occur.
1. Many PoS protocols are hardcoded not to allow reorgs

PoW states that whoever finds a block first or builds blocks faster wins. There is no direct vote to accept the block other than the majority being faster than the attacker. In PoS, the blocks need to be validated and attested by a supermajorty of validators based on staked value.

PoS networks generally set the safety threshold much higher at 67-95%. Instead of just needing 30-50% of miners to attack the network, they now have to hold 67-98% of all staked value on the blockchain, which is usually orders of magnitude more expensive than the value of mining equipment. Also, anyone who attacks the network is hurting their own staked assets.

If the Safety threshold is N%, the Censorship threshold is (1-N)%. If it takes 80% of the network to attack the safety of the network, it only takes 20% of the network to prevent the network from producing blocks. The network will halt before it can revert.

In addition, because the safety threshold is much higher, many PoS protocols are hardcoded to ignore reorgs. If a validator presents a double-spend or repeat transactions/blocks, it's immediately slashed or ignored by every other node.

The downside is that they are usually weaker against censorship attacks. But unlike Bitcoin forks that only produce blocks every 2-10 minutes, PoS networks usually produce blocks once every 1-30 seconds, so censored transactions will eventually make it through due to having more opportunities to make it through blocks. Some PoS blockchain even have protocols that practically prevent censorship by splitting responsibilities for block producers and block validators.

Due to needing to hold stake, censorship attacks don't even happen on PoS. It's just economically disadvantageous to temporarily halt a network, hurt its reputation, and risk the value of their own stake. The amount of damage to the attackers would exceed the amount of damage to the network, and it wouldn't accomplish much other than temporarily slowing down block production. I can't think of any instance of a censorship attack that wasn't accidentally caused by a validator/node bug.

------

As for double-spending ...

I'm going to backtrack a bit. It's actually really hard to double-spend on either PoW or PoS because full nodes are often coded to disallow double-spending even when the blockchain reorgs. Basically, they ignore consensus protocol when abnormalities are detected.

However, this makes it really awkward for PoW networks because full nodes choosing to ignore the longest/heaviest chain are forced to create a new fork without the reorged blocks. But they can't prevent the attacker from switching again to the new fork and attacking it too. Basically the blockchain will be broken as long as the attacker maintains 51% of the total mining power.","There are 2 main reasons:

1. In PoS protocols, the censorship threshold usually kicks in much earlier than the safety threshold, so PoS blockchains will halt before any reorgs can occur.
1. Many PoS protocols are hardcoded not to allow reorgs

PoW states that whoever finds a block first or builds blocks faster wins. There is no direct vote to accept the block other than the majority being faster than the attacker. In PoS, the blocks need to be validated and attested by a supermajorty of validators based on staked value.

PoS networks generally set the safety threshold much higher at 67-95%. Instead of just needing 30-50% of miners to attack the network, they now have to hold 67-98% of all staked value on the blockchain, which is usually orders of magnitude more expensive than the value of mining equipment. Also, anyone who attacks the network is hurting their own staked assets.

If the Safety threshold is N%, the Censorship threshold is (1-N)%. If it takes 80% of the network to attack the safety of the network, it only takes 20% of the network to prevent the network from producing blocks. The network will halt before it can revert.

In addition, because the safety threshold is much higher, many PoS protocols are hardcoded to ignore reorgs. If a validator presents a double-spend or repeat transactions/blocks, it's immediately slashed or ignored by every other node.

The downside is that they are usually weaker against censorship attacks.

I love Saylor and think he's a genius but I'm looking for someone who can give me a coherent explanation (like i'm 5) why this MSTR premium exists. 

Can the MSTR premium persist through a crypto winter? If not, the MSTR valuation should implode.

Why buy MSTR when you can get 2.77x more bitcoin? Isn't 2.77 in the hand better than 1 in the hand?   

People once arbitraged the kim chee premium. Why couldn't this premium be arbitraged away?

Bitcoin: $90K
MSTR bitcoin holdings: $26B
MSTR market cap:  $72B
MSTR value/MSTR BTC holdings value: 2.77x


This looks like a price dislocation to me, but I'd like to know if i'm missing something. Am I dumb or is the market dumb?","I love Saylor and think he's a genius but I'm looking for someone who can give me a coherent explanation (like i'm 5) why this MSTR premium exists.

This legislation will allow Pennsylvania's State Treasurer to invest up to 10% of the State General Fund, the Rainy Day Fund, and the State Investment Fund in Bitcoin. 

I think that we are going to have to do a little bit of political activism here because when I called my State Representative's Harrisburg office on Friday to let them know that it is important to me that they support this bill the staff who I spoke with told me that becasue Representative Michael Cabell's (the Representative who introduced the bill) term will end on November 30th it is unlikely that this bill will go anywhere. 

We need to get at least one of our District Representatives to sign on to co-sponsor this legislation. If you are from Pennsylvania it is crucial that you contact your House Representative right away and ask them to do this. 

We have a real chance here to be the first state to do this and we all know why the first state to get this done will be the one that benefits the most.

Bitcoin, by contrast, has no management, no dilution, and no risk of human intervention or government control. It’s a decentralized asset that can act as money or a store of value.

This made me rethink money. I trade my time, my most valuable asset, for FIAT that loses at least 2% of its value every year, forcing me to spend now or invest in risky assets to preserve purchasing power. Bitcoin offers an alternative—its fixed supply and decentralization preserve the value of my time without relying on constant speculation or risk (short term volatility not equal to long-term risk).","I asked myself what I’m really looking for.

It isn't anywhere close to true. At it's core, he's right. Inflationary money supply leads to higher prices of scarce assets (commodities, stocks, etc). But he's wrong in saying that a 10% increase in the money supply means that a 10% increase in the stock market is a wash for your investments.

1) A 10% rise in money supply doesn't equate to a 10% rise in consumer prices of goods.
2) The stock market's capital size is far greater than the circulating money supply. A 10% increase in one is far different in absolute terms than a 10% rise in the other. In other words, 10% rise in money supply won't move the stock market 10%.
3) The fed has a lot of tools at their disposal that can be equated to ""increasing money supply"", but not all of them have direct impacts on consumer good prices. Quantitative easing, interest rates, reserve and excess ratios, etc.
4) Some money goes into savings or recapitalization of banks and thus doesn't impact consumer prices, at least not immediately.
5) When you invest in the stock market, your entire point of investing is to make gains against the price of goods (CPI inflation). This way you've saved for the future with savings while growing those savings with real returns above CPI inflation. 

TLDR, no the money supply growing 10% does not wipe out stock market returns of 10%. If consumer good pricing (CPI inflation) equaled what you made in the stock market, then that would be true since your nominal returns wouldn't surpass the rise in price of goods. But that not what he said and that's a very important distinction to understand.","This is absolutely not true at all.

2024-11-03,BTC,Bitcoin,comment,1gin6ma,lv7mvgf,t1_lv75jo0,,"When it comes to currency you have nations that are currency issuers and currency users. 

US, England, Japan, China etc…are all currency issuers. They can essentially just print money and can export their money. Zimbabwe and other nations also issue currency and could export if people actually wanted it.

Eurozone countries are currency users for example, they can’t export currency cause they don’t issue it. They just use it and are actually in debt to the issuer, in the case of France, the ECB. 

Because the United States is seen as so stable, our military is able to enforce economic policies, and the petro-dollar, the dollar is seen as desirable. People WANT dollars. This means the US is able to run major trade deficits. 

In nations like Zimbabwe, they can’t run deficits. They manufacture basic industrial stuff, maybe some textiles, or rare earth stuff, but anything complicated is imported. They can’t afford to run deficits, because they need to export and collect dollars to pay for the essentials like medicine. Or they need to pay a premium in Zimbabwe-bucks. Because they can’t export enough, they resort to predatory loans from the IMF or printing their currency like crazy, or both when they can’t service the debt, which is probably denominated in dollars anyway

So, in summary, the bitcoiner tends to believe that hyper-inflation is inherent to all fiat currencies. This is not true. It’s only inherent to fiat currencies that are undesirable. 

The inflation we experienced in the US has historically been a problem of too much demand for too little supply. Sure, part of that is excess money in the system which means that people can buy more and supply can’t keep up. But, production tends to flow towards outsized prices and things balance out. It was also because Covid shocked supply chains and reduced supply. Hyper-inflation is totally different. Hyper inflation is when countries can’t get basic goods and can’t service debts that are issued in currency they don’t control. So they attempt to print their way out. 

Any pain the US economy is facing isn’t inherent to fiat. It’s because wage growth has not kept up. Prices have increased on many things (not oil adjusted for inflation), but that’s an issue of supply and demand. Or because things are more complicated. A car in 1975 didn’t have nearly the amount of technology in it, so is it more expensive now? Sure! But it also has air conditioning. 

This party will come to end one day. But not tomorrow, and probably not for many many years.","When it comes to currency you have nations that are currency issuers and currency users. 

US, England, Japan, China etc…are all currency issuers. They can essentially just print money and can export their money. Zimbabwe and other nations also issue currency and could export if people actually wanted it.

Eurozone countries are currency users for example, they can’t export currency cause they don’t issue it. They just use it and are actually in debt to the issuer, in the case of France, the ECB. 

Because the United States is seen as so stable, our military is able to enforce economic policies, and the petro-dollar, the dollar is seen as desirable. People WANT dollars. This means the US is able to run major trade deficits. 

In nations like Zimbabwe, they can’t run deficits. They manufacture basic industrial stuff, maybe some textiles, or rare earth stuff, but anything complicated is imported. They can’t afford to run deficits, because they need to export and collect dollars to pay for the essentials like medicine. Or they need to pay a premium in Zimbabwe-bucks. Because they can’t export enough, they resort to predatory loans from the IMF or printing their currency like crazy, or both when they can’t service the debt, which is probably denominated in dollars anyway

What are your theories moving forward thru 2025 and beyond? Specifically in “bear markets”, because it’s become obvious BTC is here to stay.

Blackrock and Fidelity can’t get enough of it and are starting to recommend allocations to clients, countries are starting to consider reserves and Saylor is changing the entire corporate landscape in the US.

A trust is an agreement, not an entity.  A trustee is enTRUSTed with assets by a grantor to hold for the benefit of a beneficiary.  That's it.

You, as the trustee (and possibly all three roles) have legal ownership and control of the assets, crypto or otherwise.

Whose assets are being used to create the trust?  Assuming that they have yet to be used to purchase the crypto, Fidelity is an option to open a brokerage account in your capacity as trustee that will allow you to buy/sell crypto and other assets.

If you already have the coins, and don't want to sell them, you should look into custodial ownership so that control of the crypto can be transferred easily when you cease to be trustee on your death, incapacity, or resigation.","I think you're missing out on a lot of information here.

My biggest concern about Bitcoin valuation is if they do start building up national Bitcoin reserves (as was pitched), that will send volatility on it through the roof and make it a further rigged market if you have govt traders selling to hedge.


If they decide to deregulate without going down what I consider to be an incredibly stupid path of strategic Bitcoin reserves, then that's the best outcome. Any private market wants shorter volatility for long term gains.","Yeah, that's actually fair - the crypto industry itself I think will get a boost, assuming that Gensler's replacement can get deregulation going fast (Trump can't actually fire Gensler but he would likely get demoted or resign before his term is up in 2026)

Learn how Bitcoin works: https://coinguides.org/bitcoin-change-address-output/

Every time you spend a UTXO or UTXOs (send a transaction), the leftover BTC will be sent to a new change address of yours.

For example, say you have a 0.09001000 BTC UTXO (unspent transaction output) and you want to send 0.06 BTC to Bobby. You send spend the 0.09001000 BTC UTXO and send 0.06 BTC to Bobby and you spend 0.0001 BTC on the transaction fee and the leftover 0.03 BTC will be sent to your change address that is controlled by the same wallet that you sent the transaction from.

UTXOs need to be spent in full. Think of it like breaking a bill. Say you have a twenty dollar bill and you want to buy something that costs three dollars. The merchant is going to give you back seventeen dollars as change.

Blockchain.com likes to lock users' accounts and freeze users' funds. They do this more than any other exchange.

That's arguably a recent phenomenon. The problem is there's no economic spam filter. In fact, there's a big incentive to create as much economic spam as possible since the money more or less spoils quickly.

Bitcoin, built on proof-of-work which was designed to prevent spam, imposes that same filter on the adopters. Over time the people who don't understand what's valuable will be pushed out while those who produce value will acquire more.

This means it can't just be going up forever; it is also a function is this sentiment.

If that is the case, the next logical question is what changes this? Is it number of active wallets, number of stores accepting it, total value transacted in real terms, number of active wars, the size of the monetary bases M0, M1, or M2+, prevailing interest rates, alternative investment opportunities available, or any other factor. The point is, it can't be forever up, so it's worth looking into what are possible drivers of these price changes. 

And if that is not the case, then I don't get it.

Above is about whether or not the supply is fixed.

Now moving on and assume that supply is indeed fixed, I'd compare it to another market that's has a more inelastic supply, land comes to mind. I believe it's difficult to make the case that land value, even in the raw form of a piece of undeveloped dirt lot, can only go up. Yes in general it has been in the past if you zoom out far enough, but plenty of economists argue this isn't true forever, and to me it makes sense that it doesn't.

So it's debatable whether ""supply"" is truly fixed, and even it is, we still cannot conclude the value will skyrocket.","Where it doesn't click for me is ""*supply of bitcoin is fixed but bitcoin gets lost so the circulating supply decreases over time*"", but in the hoarding en masse example, the ""supply"" effectively expands and contracts depending on holders' sentiment.

You don't want to regularly change your DCA pattern because then you will be price induced.  That might lead you to buy more when the price is high.  You might also quit buying when the price is low.

However if you feel like you can handle buying more then you might want to change your strategy.

The 80% drop should always be something that you are ready for.  When that happens you should be ready to buy more.  I used to have limit orders in place for big drops.

Keep the same plan for at least a half year based on your financial situation.  If you get a big raise then you can buy more or if you get fired then you can stop buying, but generally keep the same plan.","Great question.  This is a tough psychological question.

2024-11-27,BTC,Bitcoin,comment,1h0aeee,lz7milh,t1_lz2bwbm,,"I think the concept is intriguing, but there are still some practical and theoretical challenges that make me question how viable it is as a solution. Here are my thoughts and questions:

# 1. Collateral Valuation

Sourcing ETF or stock prices from providers like BlackRock sounds great for transparency, but what happens during periods of extreme market volatility? Stocks and ETFs can experience sharp, short-term price dips that might unfairly trigger liquidations. Are there any mechanisms to address this, like an automated delay or buffer system during volatile periods?

# 2. Dividends and Gains

The two options for handling dividends are creative, but adding dividends to collateral raises a potential concern:

* **What about taxes?** In some jurisdictions, dividends are taxable, even if they’re reinvested. Borrowers might face tax liabilities without actually receiving the cash, which could create unexpected financial stress. How would you help users navigate this?

# 3. Liquidation Mechanism

The loan-to-value (LTV) system makes sense in theory, but I’m curious about:

* **Liquidity risk for lenders:** What happens if a borrower’s collateral is liquidated but there’s no buyer for the stocks or ETFs at the given price? Would lenders take a hit in such cases?
* **Borrower stress:** Even with a buffer, forced liquidation during a bear market could leave borrowers in a worse financial position than if they had simply sold their stocks to access liquidity. Would this system be more advantageous than existing options?

# 4. BTC Price Risk

BTC volatility is a huge factor here. Borrowers might hedge BTC, lend it, or wait for recovery, but:

* **Opportunity cost:** If BTC drops significantly, borrowers could end up with less liquidity than they started with. Would this discourage risk-averse users?
* **Yield on BTC:** You mentioned lending BTC to earn yield—what would the platform for this look like? Many BTC lending platforms carry counterparty risk, which might make users wary of adding more complexity.

# 5. General Feasibility

The overall concept of unlocking liquidity without selling assets is attractive, but it feels like the system is catering to a niche audience: people who already hold significant ETF or stock investments, are knowledgeable about BTC, and are comfortable with risk.

* **What’s the target audience for this product?** For example, would it appeal more to individual investors, businesses, or high-net-worth individuals?

I like the creative thinking behind the idea, but it feels like there are a lot of moving parts that need to align perfectly for it to work. What’s your next step in exploring this further—testing it out or just gauging interest right now?","I think the concept is intriguing, but there are still some practical and theoretical challenges that make me question how viable it is as a solution.

A dusting attack is a cyberattack that sends tiny amounts of cryptocurrency to a wallet to uncover the identity of the wallet owner. The goal is to de-anonymize the wallet address. 
 
Dusting attacks can be used for a variety of purposes, including: Criminal activities, Government investigations, Network stress tests, Research purposes, and Identifying individuals with large cryptocurrency holdings. 
 
To avoid dusting attacks, you can try:
Using a hierarchical-deterministic (HD) wallet
Marking small unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) as “do not spend”

A system that was set up with the intention of fostering reward for innovation and for the driving of development through competition, if it has flaws that are not resolved, can, will, and has, led to complications that are the root cause almost every single issue with our society.  I can draw you a clear line from A to B on pretty much any issue you can imagine.  This is happening regardless of the intention of the system, and my position is not to abolish that system entirely, but to resolve the flaws. But that's all beside the point and really what I'm after is some illumination on how you believe BTC would be a positive agent of change.  I can suspend my wider understanding of things for the time being.


It appears that your position is that the system is absolutely fine as it is, and the only issue is to swap out the currency to one that would (coincidentally I'm sure) make you marginally wealthier, if it were adopted. And as far as I can tell, you only seem to recognise inflation as an issue, and the majority of remaining issues are explained as being poor spending decisions made by people who have the least impact on society, is that correct? Usually when I speak to people who believe the same things you believe, this also gets packaged up with ideas about government efficiency? Is that part of the world view for you too? 


Either way, please go back and have a look at my points.. What does BTC as currency solve? Actually describe how? Think about it like this: if your side of the fence can't convince me of these things, how are you going to convince the world that BTC is for anything other than investment speculation?  It's been 15 years.. I've not yet seen BTC manifest in any meaningful way in my reality.. if it was taken away tomorrow.. literally nothing would change.. you're going to have to start strengthening your position sooner or later.. otherwise it's an investment asset, maybe a hedge, maybe a store of value, forever.  But never adopted as a currency.


For me, the glaring issue I would like really like resolved, is how does quality of life get any better for anyone, if a small majority already own and continue to buy more BTC than everyone else.. How do things change for the better for regular people? Not in theory, but in PRACTICE. Because I suspect that the real reason your collective wants bitcoin adopted, isn't because it fixes anything, it's because it might place you significantly higher up the financial ladder than you are currently, and there isn't much more to it than that. But prove me wrong!


I don't think you BTC utopians really grasp just how weak your beliefs surrounding BTC actually are, you never seem to be able to back them up with a road map beyond ""BTC is adopted, things get better for everyone.. somehow..because no inflation"". And every single time I have this discussion, it starts with the same idealised mythology, often seemingly parroted, and the second I push back and start poking holes in it, the response usually sounds something like ""you just dont understand BTC, go read the white paper"".  No no no Kimosabe, it is YOU who doesn't understand BTC, and I think on some level you are aware of that fact.


Saying things like ""it's not a failing of BTC if you don't understand it"" do nothing but reinforce that belief.  The position can't be defended.. so the response is a subtle form of ad hominem, an implication that the person asking the question shows ignorance by simply questioning a narrative. 


BTC is not complex or new, it's literally tech from the 70s. IMO the notion that it is somehow beyond people's understanding is just part of the mythology.. A cryptographic key must be solved by multiple computers to confirm the addition of data to the Blockchain. Multiple, independent confirmations of that data ensure it's validity.  The Blockchain can then be used to make changes in data that can be tracked and cannot be falsified.  The process of mining allows for steady availability of new data valid for inclusion on Blockchain.  That data can not be falsified or duplicated, so can be used as a commodity and for exchange purposes.  Allegedly a limit on ""mining"" means it cannot be inflated (although not according to some BTC devs who say it's possible to change the maximum mining limit).  The end.  Your community doesn't seem to want to admit that any predictions about HOW BTC would impact society, if it were adopted, are nothing but speculation presented as an inevitable fact and with unfounded confidence.


You also keep telling me my position, and then engaging with that instead of the flaws I have presented with BTC adopted as currency. Please don't do that it's annoying.  I know what being poor is like thankyou. And my outlook is clearly a lot more complex than ""rich people bad"".


So, you gonna walk me through how BTC actually makes something, ANYTHING better, or what? Or are you going to continue to sidestep and make arguments unrelated to BTC adoption? You can have your pick of what you want to focus on..


Or, I'll keep it simple and take a single slither of the problem pie for you.. let's pick **unaffordability of homes.. hypothetically BTC is made the global currency tomorrow.. how is this issue getting fixed or improved as a result?**. Your choice what you address.  But it's GOT to be better than just ""people are gonna spend their money better"".. they can do that now, and according to you, they don't.. as a result of nothing but their own poor decisions apparently lol","Try just for a moment to step away from politicising what I am saying, and not reducing my arguments to an oversimplification so that they are easier to dismiss.

Talking to a close relative yesterday they brought up btc and how it's been going up so much. And genuinely angry at me they almost shouted ""Why didn't you try harder to convince me to buy when it was low?!""

I could just hear their regret and anger, somehow misplaced on me. They had a good chunk of money that would've been life changing if converted to btc at that time. 

So my reply to them was, well why dont you buy some now, everything I told you about btc still holds true today.

And their not surprising response was: No it's too high now to buy, ill just put my money in a term deposit.  
  
This is so very sad to me, i explained the fundamentals again, and again tried to convince them but they said it's just too high now. The saddest part is that if/when there is a big dip, i just know they also wont buy cause now it's too low. 

Too high or too low they just wont buy :( I feel bad for them and the regret they will feel","Talking to a close relative yesterday they brought up btc and how it's been going up so much.

**The expiry is far enough in the future to where BTC has to outright fail it's base case (long term uptrend we've always seen from BTC as it's adoption has grown) for Saylor to be forced to pay cash**. At the same time he just effectively expedited adoption of BTC by beginning this treasury service, supporting the base/bull case of BTC to some degree - not that Saylor is single handedly driving up BTC demand but he is at least helping it indirectly by anchoring his companies value to providing treasury services for the growing value/volatility/adoption of BTC.

  
A key element here is that the bond buyers cant just call their money back whenever. The bond is a contract and Saylor is exposing himself to essentially free capital given the 0% interest rate. The only reason it's not a free money glitch is what I alluded too with BTC failing. BTC has to see a crash of unprecedented levels for MSTR to go bankrupt. If it doesn't? MSTR WILL outperform BTC as long as it takes this approach and doesn't make egregious miscalculations.

  
Even if somehow price goes sideways for years and never triggers conversion, yes Saylor would have to sell BTC to pay issued debt. But as long as BTC doesnt start some long term downtrend or have a day where it tanks back to sub $50k levels, this setup will still be net positive in the long run. And Saylor can just keep raising cheap capital to grow holdings while adjusting the conversion price/timeframe to be more suitable for his goal of accumulating BTC.

  
But it's important to emphasize the upside of this play because that is what bulls are excited about and, aside from being innovative, half of why it deserves the attention it has. As long as the intermediate/long term base case for BTC plays out anywhere close to how it should the way fiat is debasing (bear market bottom between current prices/prev ATH and up to 200-300k sometime around or soon after the next halving) MSTR will easily do another 10-15x over the next few years.","If BTC is up 50%, the bonds convert to stock which are now up 50%.

2024-11-15,BTC,Bitcoin,post,1gs9q38,,,Germany Selling All Its Bitcoin: What Were They Thinking?!,"Germany Selling All Its Bitcoin: What Were They Thinking?!
I’ve been thinking about how Germany sold all the Bitcoin it seized from criminal activities, and honestly, it still blows my mind how short-sighted that decision was. Like, did nobody stop and think about what Bitcoin could be worth down the line?

Here’s the thing: Bitcoin’s value has skyrocketed over the years, and while I get that governments might be skeptical about crypto, selling all of it instead of holding at least some as a long-term investment feels like a massive financial blunder. Imagine the billions they could’ve made if they’d just waited a few years.

Other countries and organizations have figured it out—El Salvador is using Bitcoin to boost its economy, and even private companies like Tesla and Microstadegy are holding on to their BTC for the long haul. As you all well know. Now the US is talking about holding a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Which will set off a Bitcoin race to see which country can stack the most Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Germany just cashed out early like a gambler taking their chips off the table after one small win. Putting their country behind the eight ball in this Bitcoin Arms race to come.

What makes it worse is that the funds could’ve been used for something meaningful—public projects, tech innovation, or even funding blockchain research. But nope, they dumped it, probably thinking it was the ""responsible"" thing to do.

I know governments have their reasons, but this screams lack of foresight to me. Bitcoin isn’t going away, and Bitcoin is the gold standard. Why not keep it as a hedge or reserve asset?

 Germany will regret this decision in the long run? With more countries be holding Bitcoin instead of selling. This decision will go down in history as one of the worst nation state financial blunders in history.

Let me know your thoughts.","I’ve been thinking about how Germany sold all the Bitcoin it seized from criminal activities, and honestly, it still blows my mind how short-sighted that decision was. Like, did nobody stop and think about what Bitcoin could be worth down the line?

SparrowWallet is the wallet software that shows you your balances, and chooses the UTXOs for your spending transactions.

It is able to determine your Bitcoin balances, and which UTXOs you have to spend by connecting to a full node (though usually an Electrum Server like Electrs or Fulcrum).

SparrowWallet does not have the private keys, so it cannot sign any spending transactions, it can only make unsigned transactions.

Your Airgapped hardware wallet is offline, it has no idea what your balances are, what the time or date is, and what UTXOs you have to spend, or how many confirmations.

You transfer the unsigned PSBT / QR code to your Coldcard, it verifies that it is a valid transaction, displays how much you are sending, what the mining fee is, and the address you are sending to on the Coldcard screen for you to check and confirm.

Once you have confirmed everything is correct, you sign the transaction / PSBT on Coldcard, then transfer the Signed transaction back to SparrowWallet (airgapped is safest), then you can Broadcast the signed transaction to the Electrs/Fulcrum on the full node that SparrowWallet is connected to.

This then enters the Mempool, and will eventually be mined and includes into a block.","> I am confused as to how my Coldcard Q is helping keep my BTC safe when I am doing all of my sending/receiving from Sparrow

Now it seems they have eaten through most of the willing sellers. There are no sellers left. Now even the regular non-ETF market has more buyers than sellers, price goes up on weekends too.

I already addressed that point. It’s normal that money doesn’t have intrinsic yield. You have to loan it out to get interest.  That applies for gold, dollars, and Bitcoin alike. It doesn’t make money worthless, because money serves a different purpose.

Financial instruments like bonds and stocks still exist in a world with a Bitcoin monetary standard.","> it won’t bring you any gain by itself to you (  like Bonds via Coupon Payments or Stocks via Dividends would do )

I sold during Covid. At the time I lost my job, had a baby and needed the money real bad. 

Thankfully I’m in a better position compared to 4 years ago and now finally back in the game. 

Had I not sold at the time, I would be sitting on £40k+ today. It does hurt knowing I missed out on a small fortune but it is what it is. Becoming a father with no job during a global crisis ruined me, but thankfully I invested early and had some money to support us. 

My long term plan is to invest small amounts every week. Probably between £25-£50 a week. I will not fold this time. 

Wish me luck!","I sold during Covid. At the time I lost my job, had a baby and needed the money real bad.

Also, Bitcoin is LITERALLY meant to spend.. once it's VALUE benefits (i.e. accrued worth) attain a certain level in your life. The vast majority of wealthy people pass into murky to dark spirit worlds.. as idolizing money (or feeling somehow it relates to your own worth) is fool's gold. It is the LOVE & TRUTH condition of your half-soul which determines the brightness and beauty of the next world you move to. Your opinion on the matter means literally ZERO to the LOVE LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE. as your real job during Earth life which virtually everyone fails miserably is to learn LOVE & TRUTH from Absolute, not Relative perspective.

That said, I sold a bunch of BTC at $98k and bought a Ford Shelby GT350R. This is literally one of the most enjoyable vehicles to drive EVER. It is an investment in JOY and HAPPINESS and nothing else. I will keep it shiny & immaculate for 15 years and drive it maybe once or twice a week on curvy mountainside roads. 

Since it is a unique and no longer manufactured vehicle it may retain some value.. but that doesn't matter. The universe does NOT THINK in dollar value terms.. that is a human-wrought collective belief many of you wield deep in your subconscious. I am 100% non-religious.. but assure you, God does NOT CARE about money.. but rather your heart and understanding of true laws of love.

Now that you're buying Bitcoin, you should learn more about what it is you have bought. If you don't learn these fundamentals, you will sell it out of fear and in 1, 5, 10 years you will be very angry with yourself for not knowing more.

Bitcoin isn't an investment. Its the hardest form of money we as a species has ever had access to. I have compiled a shortlist of videos to help aid your understanding. The 4th video is the real gem in this list and I'd suggest watching it first. It teaches you key concepts about money. Once these concepts are understood, you can look at Bitcoin & the US dollar and fully understand what makes bitcoin ""money"", and the US dollar (a fiat currency).. and the implications of both.

Start here:

Clip 1: What bitcoin is, the problem it fixes, and why its the solution  
[https://youtu.be/pBmK3pI7uKw?si=n59JkGuJ\_gP\_dEd5](https://youtu.be/pBmK3pI7uKw?si=n59JkGuJ_gP_dEd5)

Clip 2: Why you never need to sell bitcoin.

Clip 3: All Fiat currencies in history have gone to zero, the American Dollar (which is fiat.. meaning has no sound money (like gold or bitcoin) backing it. The gold backing of the dollar ended in 1971 with Nixon, which is when the dollar became fiat currency)  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJDqQn7WC1U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJDqQn7WC1U) 

Clip 4: The difference between ""Currency"" & ""Money"".. What is sound money, and why gold (and now bitcoin) fits this description (This series was originally made in 2010, before bitcoin was well known). Feel free to watch all 10 videos in the series in your spare time, but if you do anything, at least watch the 1st vid in the series. (This might be the most important video here)  
[https://youtu.be/DyV0OfU3-FU?si=OqJ93-gHpcQjsvRH](https://youtu.be/DyV0OfU3-FU?si=OqJ93-gHpcQjsvRH)

Clip 5: Inflation & hyper inflation - the end result of the use of Fiat currency  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNNUVEfoNmE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNNUVEfoNmE)

There's a lot of information here, and there's so much more out there that can be learned of course. However, when you come out the other side of this information, you will have a solid foundation. This is the type of thing that puts you ahead of most people in the market as most people don't understand these concepts. MOST people will never learn these things, and they will fall victim to the effects of flawed monetary systems. I hope this information finds you well.","As others have said, you dont ""get it"" simply by seeing number go up. However, I can help.

2024-11-12,BTC,Bitcoin,post,1gpgkme,,,What is your biggest regret in bitcoin?,"What is your biggest regret in bitcoin?
Hello everyone!

First of all, congratz on 90k.

This is my first post in the btc community, i would like to share with you all my biggest regrets in bitcoin and the crypto world:

1 - not having enough of an open mind to buy bitcoin early

I first heard about bitcoin in back in 2015 - 2016, from one of my friends in uni and unfortunately for me my mentality back then was not investment oriented, but hey i guess everyone has to go through certain phases to reach or be where they are today.

2 - not managing my spending wise enough.

I think managing personal expenditures is not something easy for anyone, most people spend way more than they can afford let alone investing wisely.

Personally this has been one of biggest challenges, but it also taught me a lot, still to this day, i try to spend as least as possible because i know that in the near future that money will easily be a minimum of x2 - x4 if invested in btc, probably more if managed properly.

3 - not taking profit

Hodling for dear life isn’t necessarily a bad strategy, for most people this can actually be the best decision they ever made, but taking some profit while in price discovery mode is not a bad idea, after all bitcoin is cyclical.

Selling or at least DCA on the way up is a very safe play, that way if it does keep going up you would still have bitcoin, and if it goes down you could always buy more, a very simple idea but if applied properly, conservatively and wisely can make you wealthy, but also helps the market by stabilizing it. 

4 - over leveraging

Last but not least is leverage.

In 2022 i was foolish enough to have an over leveraged long position with no stop loss, which has been by far my biggest financial loss that ever occurred to me, but also taught me a big lesson.

That being said, i came back stronger this cycle, and hopefully this long pain and struggle i went through was actually all i ever needed, it has set me on the right path.

In short, don’t over leverage, or don’t leverage at all, unless you are a pro with tons of experience, don’t fool yourself into thinking you know how to use it, almost all beginners don’t

Stay strong bitcoiners 💪","Hello everyone!

Strategic reserves make sense to safeguard the US economy against supply shocks in critical economic inputs. Oil being the key example. Bitcoin isn’t an economic input.

But the volatility of Bitcoin makes it a worse option than gold for that purpose, at least in terms of taxpayer optics. Boring price movements are better here. 

The government does have a bunch of confiscated bitcoin already, so they could just appropriate that stack and call it the strategic reserve for political kudos.

Are there any Bitcoin Core emulators that anyone can suggest?

I basically want to run Bitcoin Core commands to extract raw transaction data.

I don't want to set up a node again however for a bunch of reasons; partly laziness as well as but mostly the fact that I want to be able to run these commands on my Windows laptop.  I also need to be able to have other users with Windows computers do the same thing.

To be honest, an easily installed Windows app would be just as good.

Stablecoins are already being used in countries where money is unstable or banks are hard to access. They let people store value and make transactions without needing a bank account, which can be life-changing for communities that don’t have access to traditional financial systems.

Bitcoin is different—it’s more like a digital version of gold than something you’d spend every day. What makes it unique is that there’s a hard limit of 21 million bitcoins, built into its design. That means no one can just create more out of thin air, unlike regular money, where governments can print more and cause inflation. It’s also secure and can’t be tampered with, thanks to the technology behind it. This scarcity and security are what give Bitcoin value.

One of Bitcoin’s most powerful features is that you can send it to anyone, anywhere, without needing permission or worrying about government restrictions. That’s part of why it’s so interesting—and also why it gets criticized depending on how people use it.

In the end, Bitcoin isn’t here to replace the dollar but to offer an alternative. Think of it like digital gold—it holds value, is easy to move, and isn’t controlled by anyone.

I was there when btc was approx .01 Yes , that early. 

One click from a 23,000 BTC  transaction. Chickened out because I wasn't  familiar with authenticators back in early 2009.  Yeap, that early

I am disappointed now , but things didn't align for me. 

What i have learned and my point being is that as bitcoin gets pricey, the government will find ways to tax the holy crap out of it.  I paid an  average 54% every year on all my gains since 2017. That is ridiculous, in my opinion, as it will only get worse as it hits 100k.  We buy it with overly taxed money just to make more money to be taxed even more.  

The cycle can and will only get worse. 

Happy for the all the holders.  No hate here.  Just a deep understanding of how the system works from trading it yearly. 

One good rug pull, and we are all broke worse than before.  

Remember, politicians say whatever is needed to facilitate their progression forward.

I've been sitting on a MultiBit Classic wallet for ~10 years, not paying attention.  It looks like I need to upgrade to something like Electrum, so I'm attempting to export my keys. 

BUT, the Multibit software is stuck on ""Synchronizing"", and the ""Export Private Keys"" option is grayed out. 

Is there a way to do a direct conversion?  Or a way to extract the keys directly from the wallet file?

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) Global Inc. (COIN) has demonstrated significant growth, meeting several key benchmarks considered by the S&P 500 Index Committee. However, its performance is closely tied to the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin. This correlation is evident, as Coinbase's stock price often mirrors Bitcoin's fluctuations. For instance, during bullish Bitcoin trends, Coinbase experiences increased trading volumes and revenues, leading to higher stock valuations. Out off all the likely companies [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) is in my top 3 for inclusion this Rebalance.  
  
The forthcoming S&P 500 rebalance will indeed be indicative of the Index Committee's perspective on integrating companies like Coinbase, which are deeply embedded in the cryptocurrency sector. Inclusion of such a company would signal a significant shift towards embracing the evolving financial landscape and acknowledging the growing prominence of digital assets. Conversely, opting not to include Coinbase might suggest a more cautious approach, reflecting concerns about the inherent volatility and regulatory uncertainties associated with the crypto market. Therefore, the committee's decision will not only impact Coinbase but also serve as a broader statement on the acceptance of digital asset platforms within traditional financial indices.

[TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/fiO01sTb-Dynamic-Relationship-Between-Bitcoin-and-Coinbase/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The S&P 500 Index Committee employs specific criteria for inclusion, such as market capitalisation, liquidity, domicile, public float, and financial viability. While Coinbase may satisfy these quantitative measures, the committee also exercises qualitative judgment, considering factors like market stability and the company's role within its industry.

[Corporate Finance Institute](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/sp-500-index/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Given Coinbase's substantial exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency market, the committee might deliberate on the potential risks associated with such volatility. The decision to include a company so intertwined with the crypto sector would reflect the committee's stance on the evolving financial landscape and its readiness to integrate digital asset platforms into traditional indices.

In summary, while Coinbase appears to meet the fundamental requirements for S&P 500 inclusion, its strong correlation with Bitcoin introduces considerations that the committee will likely scrutinise, balancing traditional financial principles with the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market.","[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) Global Inc.

A 51% attack can only be used to rewrite the block chain. Which allows you do double spend your *own* Bitcoin (for which you already *have* the private keys). I.e., spend them once (for example as part of a transaction to buy fiat currency with them, or to buy some goods), then rewrite the block chain and spend the same Bitcoin again, this time sending them to a new address that is  under your own control too. You would then end up with still having your Bitcoin, but also having the fiat/goods that you bought with them.


So, stealing Bitcoin is not something a 51% attacker could do. (Unless you count ""stealing back"" your previously owned Bitcoin from a transaction you initiated yourself as ""stealing"".)


What the attack *would* do however, would be to undermine trust into Bitcoin. Any big holder of Bitcoin (who doesn't have nefarious anti-Bitcoin goals themselves) would obviously not want trust into Bitcoin to be diminished. If this translates into an incentive to shore up mining against 51% attacks depends on the particular holder.","You cannot steal someone else's Bitcoin (assets) with a 51% attack (exception for ""stealing back"", see below).

Hey mate. I can't give advice or suggest how to time the market. Anything could happen from here; we could be back at 60K or run to 100K, you know what I mean? If you're starting a DCA, then any time is good.

Regarding the ADA, that's what we call a shitcoin. They usually have a similar profile:

* A founder/CEO
* Marketing team
* Premined allocation around 60-70% (meaning they just create coins for free while you are paying)


Most importantly, they have the ability to pivot and change the coin/code as often as they want. An example of this is ETH changing their entire monetary policy from proof of work to proof of stake.

These properties mean these kinds of tokens only pretend to be decentralized. While Bitcoin truly is. No one can control it.

This plays in Bitcoin's favor all the time, and while shitcoins might have short-lived pumps, everything trends to zero against Bitcoin over the long term. Things like alt season are no guarantee. The market is not destined to repeat itself.

So, about the choice between Bitcoin and other projects, I think there's no contest if you plan on holding 5+ years.

Good luck.","

Idk at what price/when that'll be but considering all the factors; Media narratives, weakening central bank currencies, tech companies reserving and mining more, the current 87-89k resistance and general narrative of $100,000... It'll plummet near $95,000 back to somewhere around $60,000.

A lot of this directly depends on whether Trump's cabinet actually go through with that absolutely fucking mental tariff plan (unlikely), or how they change the plan and react to the federal reserve. Bitcoin is more heavily reactive to the dollar now due to Elon basically being the shadow president and there will be a major major recession very soon. So the rebound could result in Btc reaching upwards of $120,000 in early 2025 but hell, only time will tell.

China is also gonna be pumping this market a lot more now so keep an eye on that too. Bitcoin isn't a stock, and it isn't a currency (or shouldn't be treated like one). It's closest to Gold or other commodities heavily involved in geopolitics. Most people lose their money on crypto and it's cuz they do these really short term trades that bite them in the ass when something unexpected happens.","I'd be really careful, the price will crash once investment firms solidify their profits and have actualised control over most mining.

Mining secures Bitcoin because it uses a process called proof-of-work, where miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles. These puzzles are tough because they require finding a hash output with specific properties, which is only possible through trial and error. This means fucking with any transaction in the blockchain would require re-mining not just that block, but all the blocks past that which is computationally near impossible. This means you can't change the chain and the network is secure. So security it built into the system. No need for trusting some outside entity.

These puzzles are tough because they require finding a hash output with specific properties, which is only possible through trial and error. This means fucking with any transaction in the blockchain would require re-mining not just that block, but all the blocks past that which is computationally near impossible. This means you can't change the chain and the network is secure. So security it built into the system. No need for trusting some outside entity. How do explain that to chorus of trad retail people who haven't the slightest clue how things work? Answer: I don't and let them chase the top.",1,,,,reddit

Satoshi understood this from the beginning. Bitcoin being used by large entities was ALWAYS viewed as inevitable. The fact that anyone can use it doesn't change it's decentralization, distributed ledger, or permissionless access.



The more you study Bitcoin the more you'll realize it's price can only be manipulated for a period of time before a reckoning of price discovery must occur. It's like trying to hold a giant inflatable beach ball under water for a long time. Eventually it will pop back up. This is because, unlike gold, bitcoins supply is verifiable and easily portable. Bitcoin can be demanded instantly, whereas taking possession of gold is impractical and unlikely.","Bitcoin was designed to be permissionless.

Sup plebs.

Since years bitcoin grew to be my biggest passion and hobby. I do have some small other hobbies like sports and gaming but nothing really compares to bitcoin in the way that I love talking about it. 

When I go on dates I never talk about bitcoin because I think it's probably not a good idea to smack them the whole monetary-fiat-problem and decentralized money topic right into their face after knowing them for such a short time period lol

So I sat there some days ago with a girl and thought what the fuck do I even talk about interesting when I can't talk about my biggest passion.

Shit is serious hard, how do you plebs handle it? Sometimes I have the feeling I'm a lil but autistic because bitcoin is filling so much of my life while I can't find joy in the things that most other guys&girls in my age group are doing.","Sup plebs.

2024-11-09,BTC,Bitcoin,post,1gnhb21,,,Creating a Family and Friends Insurance Pool with Bitcoin Wallets,"Creating a Family and Friends Insurance Pool with Bitcoin Wallets
Hey everyone!

I wanted to share something I’ve been experimenting with recently—using a Bitcoin wallet to set up a kind of “family and friends insurance” pool. Essentially, we’re using a pooled savings model to insure our collective risks, but with a twist: the whole thing is managed using Bitcoin.

Here’s the idea: my close family and friends have all chipped in a bit of money, which we keep in a Bitcoin wallet. This pool is specifically for certain risks—like covering repairs or replacements for our tech (phones, laptops, etc.), medical emergencies, or unexpected financial hits. It’s not a traditional insurance policy, but we all agree on what kinds of things we’re willing to pool resources for.

The main advantage here? Flexibility, transparency, and no middlemen. We don’t need to deal with insurance companies or complex claims processes. If someone’s phone breaks, we simply pull from the pool to help cover the cost of repairs or replacement. Plus, we’re all contributing to the fund voluntarily and with full visibility of how much money is in the wallet, so it’s a very open process.

We’ve also added some basic rules to ensure everything stays fair:
	1.	Contribution Agreement: Each person contributes a set amount monthly, depending on their ability and the type of risk we want to cover.
	2.	Fund Management: The Bitcoin wallet is managed collectively. We all have access to see how the funds are being used, and we vote on any withdrawals.
	3.	Emergency Funds: We’ve designated a portion of the pool as “emergency savings,” for bigger, unexpected expenses that might arise.

So far, it’s been great because it feels like we’re taking control of our own financial safety net, but with the added benefit of using Bitcoin for its security and portability.

I’d love to hear if anyone else is doing something similar or has any suggestions for improving this idea!

Let me know what you think!","Hey everyone!

Plus, we’re all contributing to the fund voluntarily and with full visibility of how much money is in the wallet, so it’s a very open process.

We’ve also added some basic rules to ensure everything stays fair:
	1.	Contribution Agreement: Each person contributes a set amount monthly, depending on their ability and the type of risk we want to cover.
	2.	Fund Management: The Bitcoin wallet is managed collectively. We all have access to see how the funds are being used, and we vote on any withdrawals.
	3.	Emergency Funds: We’ve designated a portion of the pool as “emergency savings,” for bigger, unexpected expenses that might arise.

So far, it’s been great because it feels like we’re taking control of our own financial safety net, but with the added benefit of using Bitcoin for its security and portability.

I’d love to hear if anyone else is doing something similar or has any suggestions for improving this idea!

A government that do not take debt cannot fund these things that costs them money yet bring no profit. 

Different countries also have different socio-economic landscapes, different valuations of different goods and different needs for debt instruments, this is why not every country can just adopt a single international currency or why we cannot ever have every currencies pegged to single asset i.e bitcoin.

1️⃣ **Market Vibe Check**: 🌐  
Market sentiment is broadly **bullish** heading into the week. Low sentiment from bears and strong historical performance during Thanksgiving week are providing a tailwind. Expect some volatility but anticipate grinding upwards.

2️⃣ **Top Stock Plays**: 📈  
- **$MSTR**: Heavy chatter, some bullish bets surface, with fear around volatility. If BTC pops, expect MSTR to follow.  
- **$ACHR**: Strong potential for a short squeeze; high interest and bullish calls at $10. Speculated to potentially skyrocket this week.  
- **$RKLB**: Positive momentum post-launch, talks of additional launches are igniting hype. Watch for big moves.

3️⃣ **Rising Stars**: 🚀  
- **$LUNR**: Gaining traction with some potential for a squeeze this week; seen as a strong upside play.  
- **$SMCI**: Gaining popularity and expected to continue its upward trend; some are betting on it breaking new highs.

4️⃣ **Hidden Gems**: 💎  
- **$CIFR**: Low profile but has been gaining attention for a strong rebound potential; a good watch for low-risk entry.  
- **$WOLF**: Analysts are speculating about a potential short squeeze. Not heavily mentioned, but worth keeping an eye on.

5️⃣ **Forecast & Actionable Insights**: 🔮  
- **Options Strategy**: Consider bullish calls on $ACHR and $RKLB, which have significant short interests. The momentum could create strong upside this week.   
- **Risk Management**: Use puts on $MSTR to protect against unexpected sell-offs, especially given its volatility and investor anxiety.  
- **Stay Patient**: This week is typically low volume; carefully choose aggressive plays while maintaining a safety net with diversified positions, focusing on long-terms.

Why does currency work? Currency works because we all use it and trade it. 

People completely forget as well, the major reason why people started turning to bitcoin the early 2010s was because centralized banks were engaging in even worse pyramid schemes, mass quantitative easing. Essentially the government giving itself licence to print mass amounts of money and buy bonds to stimulate the economy. 

This devalued the currency massively and there was no order to how it was done. 

Bitcoin on the other hand is much more stable in how it is produced. For better or for worse, it cannot be manipulated to political ends, it is purely functional as a free-market entity, its value derives solely from whether people are in demand of it or not.","The first pyramid scheme was when one person bartering convinced someone with a goat or a cart to trade their useful product for a few shiny coins because they were linked to value located elsewhere.

Bitcoin doesn't solve the BGP.  The BGP is technically un-solvable.  The solution to the BGP is to avoid getting into that situation in the first place. 

Traditional ledgers and databases never have to deal with BGP because they use file and record locking and don't have ""double spend"" problems due to an inefficient, slow and error-prone decentralized design.

>What really makes it special in my mind was the way mining works that makes it censorship and government proof with solving the distributed trust problem. 

Unfortunately [that's false](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=2557s).

Bitcoin is neither decentralized, nor is it censorship-proof by any meaningful metric.  It's a parasite on top of existing networks that are managed by central entities, who can any time they want, filter bitcoin traffic via technical means, or use policy decisions to discourage people from using the network or face severe penalties.  

Since Bitcoin's network is decentralized, there is no 'gatekeeper' - all nodes have to be able to identify themselves on the network, therefore any admin who has any reasonable amount of experience can easily identify and block bitcoin nodes at the router level.  Since much of the Internet is consolidated across  a few select backbones, none of which are immune to censorship, it's trivially easy to ""censor"" bitcoin and its traffic.  Just because it hasn't been done, doesn't mean it can't be done.  If you know anything about system administration, you know I'm right.

>Bitcoin's blockchain is permission less money you can take across borders by memorizing 12 words, and the government can't reverse that transaction!

Having said that, many people say at least 1M sats (0.01 BTC) is a good heuristic.

I've read both as have many here, and I think most of us would agree. 

Bitcoin Standard is great but goes off the rails at points - the whole middle portion of the book, really. It starts really strong with its history of money, then he gets kooky with personal biases for a good while taking about US monetary policy in particular, then pulls it back together talking about bitcoin for the last chapters. Super fun easy read that my young daughter could probably grasp. 

Broken Money is still an easy read for lay folk like myself, but a lot more meat on the bone in terms of content. Kinda like reading Chomsky now that I think about it, in that the book is able to communicate complex ideas is an easily digestible format; no reading the same page 5 times trying to grasp some deep concept (talking to you in your grave, Marshall McLuhan). 

Now that I'm fleshing out thoughts, I think I would ideally recommend both, but bitcoin standard first, especially for someone new to bitcoin. Someone who has never heard of btc could pick up a copy bitcoin standard with zero primer and I feel could be fully enthralled, even developing interest to learn further. 

Not sure I could say the same for broken money, but I'd wager 9/10 people who have been into bitcoin awhile and are not named Saifedean, would she that broken money is a better & more complete book that gives you a better and broader understanding of money overall. 

Finally if you really want to get heavy, if there's any room left on your plate, I'd suggest something like Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell. Nothing to do with Bitcoin at all, and everything to do with how a market economy functions. Read through it keeping an eye towards how it might apply to bitcoin, and it becomes even clearer how over time it will only make sense for most everyone to use bitcoin, as it is better, and regarding a market economy when a tool is better it is generally as inevitable as gravity.",">I haven't read either, and I know recommending books I haven't read is dumb, but I'd recommend Lyn Alden's book ""Broken Money"" over Saifedean's.

The Fear and Greed Index is a widely used meter that apparently lets people know when the market has the risk of crashing or pumping. Unfortunately, no meter or index can do that, yet some Cryptocurrency ""influencers"" keep feeding the idea that the Fear and Greed Index is an accurate buy/sell signal.

The most major flaw with this index is that it is completely limited from 1-100 and the meter changes drastically even when the market changes by 10%. This means, when the meter goes from 10 (Extreme Fear) to 80 (Extreme Greed) after a good day for Crypto, the meter has barely any room for more gains. 

There could be months left for the bull market to end, and the meter would still show a ""sell"" signal. Likewise, the meter can drop to 10 after a bad day, and it can give you a buy signal even when the market has the potential to keep dipping further. It is an extremely inaccurate way to measure when to buy or sell when you can just directly look at the actual chart of the price of Cryptocurrencies.

Yes, Fear and Greed can sometimes let you know when a market is a little inflated or undervalued, but stock market theories should not apply to Crypto. Crypto can still go up wildly even with the meter at 90, and it can still crash more with the meter at 10.

Everybody has stories about missing out on timing some individual stock or option. But buying a home is a clear common goal almost everyone has, the ""buying index"" of living expenses.

I don't really put much weight in all the stories people have about how they could have gone all in and then held some absurdly long hold on a stock or bitcoin or special investment. Realistically most sensible people would have sold early or gambled equally on losing risky investments. 

But sacrificing everything else and managing to purchase a home before historic price run-ups is a plausible, sensible, goal that a lot of people could have very realistically chosen to do and I think for those who could have sacrificed more or worked more or timed better and managed to get in the housing market early enough, this is probably going to be one of the most meaningful impacts on their financial futures. I suspect there will be a generational divide among those in the generations who had the opportunity to make major sacrifices to buy housing early and did versus those who waited too long or didn't sacrifice as much and did not.","> Probably not working multiple jobs in my 20s so I could buy a house pre 2020.

I don't really put much weight in all the stories people have about how they could have gone all in and then held some absurdly long hold on a stock or bitcoin or special investment. Realistically most sensible people would have sold early or gambled equally on losing risky investments. 

But sacrificing everything else and managing to purchase a home before historic price run-ups is a plausible, sensible, goal that a lot of people could have very realistically chosen to do and I think for those who could have sacrificed more or worked more or timed better and managed to get in the housing market early enough, this is probably going to be one of the most meaningful impacts on their financial futures. I suspect there will be a generational divide among those in the generations who had the opportunity to make major sacrifices to buy housing early and did versus those who waited too long or didn't sacrifice as much and did not.",8,,,,reddit

Summary: In 2021, El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, aiming for financial inclusion and innovation. Most citizens avoided using it, citing volatility and technical issues, and cashed out their $30 Bitcoin bonus to dollars. By 2024, Bitcoin’s value surged, growing the government’s holdings by $112 million. Citizens who had used Bitcoin could have seen small investments grow to thousands of dollars.

If you are not saving for anything in particular and you would like to invest as much as possible, start with putting aside an emergency fund which should be 6 months your monthly expenses. Then a really rough starter number to invest in stocks is 100 - your age. That means if you’re 60 years old, have 40% invested in stocks. If you’ve never picked stocks before just go with an ETF such as VOO. 

With the remaining 60% you should have in safer investments. CDs or bonds that match your investment horizon. Depending on how likely you think a recession is you can float between 10-20% in cash. Depending on if you still owe on your house and the interest rate is higher than what is being offered for bonds then you put a portion to reduce this debt burden. If the interest rate for your mortgage payment is super low then it would make sense to just leave it.

Lastly you can have anywhere between 2-10% in alternative investments that aren’t typically correlated with traditional investments (stocks, real estate) such as gold (I would say Bitcoin but Bitcoin has generally been correlated with stocks over the past few years).

What a week! TSLA. PLTR. BTC. Hard to pick a loser lately. A little profit taking today from paper hands but this thing seems poised to run. Jpow said inflation is over last week. And the U.S. is about to push through massive tax cuts and regulatory reform. The rocket has already made it to moon, now we're just refueling for Mars

So what's the play going forward? Well over the past week the one thing that will likely benefit most from deregulation has been almost flat. Natural gas. 

In the U.S., gas is cheap. Dirt cheap. It's basically a waste product from oil production at this point and we just burn the stuff at the wellhead because there's not enough pipeline capacity to get it to the customers.

Domestically, we are going to need a ton of energy for everything from data centers to manufacturing and there are no sources that can be brought on as fast as natural gas. So why haven't we expanded our pipeline capacity already? Simple, regulation has made the prospect of pipeline expansion unrealistic. But that's going to change. Unlocking oil and gas is expected to be a day 1 Executive Order. 

Internationally, the picture is looking even brighter. Turns out we're the only ones with dirt cheap natural gas. The rest of the world pays 10x or more what we do for natural gas. And now the U.S. wants to dominate energy exports. We are about to see LNG exports become a cornerstone of American trade policy. 

Position- $LNG 3/21/25C, $ET 6/20/25C

Tldr: LNG and Pipelines 🚀 🚀 🚀 on day 1 Executive Orders

This is not financial advice. I'm just a fellow moron with a few news subscriptions and too much time on my hands. Do your own due diligence.","What a week! TSLA. PLTR. BTC.

Buy (MSTR) 🤑

MicroStrategy (MSTR) is poised for a potential short squeeze in the coming months, particularly if the U.S. government and U.S listed public companies engage in significant Bitcoin purchases, which would further elevate Bitcoin's price. As of today, 11/21/24, (MSTR) has an open short interest of approximately 15% of its entire float. This situation would be like the situation seen during the AMC short squeeze at the height of the meme stock phenomenon in early 2021, BUT BIGGER. AMC high volume of shorts had to cover their positions while the underlying was appreciating, driving the stock price upward. AMC's stock price surged approximately 2,300% from the end of 2020 to the beginning of June 2021. AMC short interest reached approximately 48.61 million shares, representing about 12.98% of its float right before the squeeze happened. In contrast, MicroStrategy (MSTR) currently has a short interest of around 28.33 million shares, which accounts for approximately 15.52% of its float. The market cap of (MSTR) is currently substantial higher than to AMC Entertainment even at the peak of the mania, which means the dollar value of its short position is much larger as well. AMC’s market cap reached 13B in early 2021 at the top of the short squeeze. (MSTR) market cap is currently 87B before a short squeeze has even begun. (MSTR) is the underlying of the short stock options but BITCOIN is the underlying of (MSTR). This situation is only made possible with a face melting bitcoin pump caused by the TRUMP administration buying BTC and avalanche effect thereafter. In the meantime, we will see intense volatility as traders are making bets on each side of the following question.. WILL TRUMP DIRECT AMERICA TO BUY BTC? 

(Float refers to the number of shares of a company's stock that are available for trading in the public market, excluding restricted stock which is usually held by insiders/founders. It is calculated by subtracting the number of closely held shares from the total outstanding shares.)","Buy (MSTR) 🤑

**Cryptocurrency is Worthless**

Buying a stock generally means buying shares of a company with a product, service or an actual revenue stream. Even when buying a share of stock in a company that is losing money, there is something concrete to see, hear, touch, smell or taste, so to speak. With the purchase of Cryptocurrency, there is only the belief that the share(s) will be worth more in the future, at some point, and nothing else.

This form of investment or currency is not backed by anything at all. It produces nothing of value unless it goes up and another buyer wants it at that higher price. There is nothing substantive holding it up other than the hope for that increased value. It can disappear in a puff of smoke. Only its limited quantity produces value. An AI or Quantum computer could suddenly mine a million Bitcoin, rendering the entire system worthless.

At least a stock can be valued according to its revenue or the inherent value of its assets, intellectual property or patents. Cryptocurrency lacks any of these qualities. Even cash in the bank is backed by the FDIC and our national creditworthiness. Crypto has no protections, no assets, no revenue, no product, no gold backing and no reason to buy it other than for pure speculation. One might as well sell a pound of dirt in the desert and try to get someone to pay a higher price than paid to the previous owner. Each new Crypto promises the same chance to make more on speculation. 

Putting aside the actual genius of the distributed ledger or Block Chain that can be used for any type of purchase, Crypto is a myth, an idea, a dream. That dream could disappear in a puff of smoke.  

See Warren Buffet's ideas on Crypto:  

Is it just sour grapes that I did not buy into Crypto 10 years ago when my stepson first told me about it? No. You can't go back. Now that the bubble has burst, I think even the diehard Reddit buyers are bailing.

I have always loved the idea of Bitcoin. As a person intrigued by libertarianism I saw the liberating potential. But for me to really invest outside of speculation, it would have to have a really long term persective. 

My problem and my main argument against BTC is that with huge leaps in cryptography and quantum computing I am worried that a government (China, Russia, Us, whatever) will be able to break your wallet and have total control over your money. Contrary to the core Bitcoin decentralized idea.

Is this a legit worry? I would like to hear your feedback.","I have always loved the idea of Bitcoin. As a person intrigued by libertarianism I saw the liberating potential. But for me to really invest outside of speculation, it would have to have a really long term persective.

2024-11-21,BTC,wallstreetbets,post,1gwr2dy,,,MARA Investment thesis ,"MARA Investment thesis 
I believe it’s now time for miners to catch up to the gains of MSTR and BTC.

Miners remain undervalued relative to BTC, and MARA in particular—with its Bitcoin holdings and current NAV—is poised for a significant run soon. Just compare the current NAV premium of MSTR to MARA, and the undervaluation becomes clear.

I’ve gone all-in on MARA calls since last week.

I based my calculations on an assumption of 10% daily volatility. Even when accounting for the historic relationship between BTC and MARA, the dilution of shares, and the upcoming halving, MARA still appears undervalued.

The average simulated price across all paths for December is $43.91, reflecting an overall bullish outlook. I used ChatGPT for this calculation (and to rewrite my DD).

My price target for my calls is $38, with an expiry date of December 20, 2024. I also hold additional calls for March with a strike price of $36.

The last update to my portfolio was this morning, and I plan to update it daily. However, my German broker tends to be slow with price updates.","I believe it’s now time for miners to catch up to the gains of MSTR and BTC.

Miners remain undervalued relative to BTC, and MARA in particular—with its Bitcoin holdings and current NAV—is poised for a significant run soon. Just compare the current NAV premium of MSTR to MARA, and the undervaluation becomes clear.

I’ve gone all-in on MARA calls since last week.

Taking out a 9% HELOC instead to hold you over for the next year would’ve been a great move.  Then, when it doubled in price, you take out 50% of your stack to payoff the loan.  For instance, if you took out a $50K loan, you would pay $4,500 in interest but gained $50K in BTC and still have your original $50K for future gains.  This way, you’d still have half your stack.  The one issue is, you’d have to be able to make the monthly payments on that loan for the next year.

Second, as the BTC/USD price increases, the chances of typing reaching the stack that you had become harder and harder.  Especially if you have additional expenses that a house brings.  Think of it this way, you might be lucky to reach 1/3 of the BTC that you sold.

Finally, if you live in the US, I hope that you have at least 25% set aside for Federal/Stste/Local long term capital gains taxes that are due April 15, 2025.  Using the above $50K example, this would mean that you’d have to pay $12,500 within the next 5 months.

2024-11-26,BTC,Bitcoin,post,1h06ee5,,,How I Changed My Mind About Bitcoin,"How I Changed My Mind About Bitcoin
I’ve always had an interest in crypto and even wrote a master’s thesis on blockchain and DLT. But, coming from a country with strict financial regulations, I wasn’t sure if Bitcoin could ever reach widespread adoption—especially with organizations like the European Central Bank (ECB) being cautious about it.

Then something happened that made me rethink everything.

While running my business, I occasionally worked with someone who happened to be employed at the EIB (European Investment Bank). Over lunch one day, they mentioned their personal view on Bitcoin, saying it had a lot of potential and could be the best long-term investment. (To be clear, this was their own opinion—not an official statement or anything.)

Hearing that perspective from someone working inside the system really made me reconsider. Shortly after, I decided to start shifting some of my portfolio from traditional ETFs like QQQ and SPY into BTC.

It’s funny how a single conversation can change your perspective... BTC to the moon!","I’ve always had an interest in crypto and even wrote a master’s thesis on blockchain and DLT.

Hey everybody!

I'd like to ensure that somebody I know is guaranteed to get a part of my Bitcoin in the case of me dying. Of course I could write this into my last will (and I probably will), however a solution that is directly implemented onto the Blockchain seems much more elegant to me. Does such a solution maybe already exist?

If not, I thought about a Bitcoin Script that is a multisig of two addresses, only one address is needed to sign, but the second address only becomes available at a specific block height. That way I could always renew the transaction while still breathing to some block height that is still in the future (maybe always a year or two), renewing it every 6 months. The obvious downside of this approach is that if I ever get into a situation where I can't renew (e.g. fall into a coma), that the bitcoin could then be spent early by the second address. A downside that is completely acceptable to me.

I have never written a bitcoin script before, but I think something along the lines of this should work:

    <pubkey1> OP_CHECKSIG
    OP_IF
      OP_TRUE
    OP_ELSE
      <block_height> OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP
      <pubkey2> OP_CHECKSIG
    OP_ENDIF

**!!!Do not blindly use this script! I am a beginner and it could contain some serious flaw!!!**

Any input would be very much welcome!","Hey everybody!

Just wanted to share a little bit of my experience for anyone feeling like they missed the boat on Bitcoin.

I started investing in Bitcoin April this year, when the price was around $69K. Like many, I was nervous about buying in at what seemed like a high price. But instead of worrying about the “perfect” timing, I just started by setting up some dollar-cost averaging to buy small amounts regularly, and when the price dropped into the $50Ks, I decided to sell some other assets and put in a bit more.

Now, my average is around $61K. Looking back at my returns so far, Bitcoin’s overall performance in this timeframe is about 17% while my return ended up closer to 25% (although it might seem irrelevant, I have to admit it feels good to feel that I’m beating the market when, at one point, I thought I was getting in too late). It’s not that I made the right moves, but rather that steady investing seemed to help.

For anyone feeling like it’s too late, remember that Bitcoin is still relatively new. Small, steady investments can really make a difference, and sticking to a plan is key. So if you’re on the fence, just take it slow. Sometimes just getting started is the hardest part, but you won’t regret it.","Just wanted to share a little bit of my experience for anyone feeling like they missed the boat on Bitcoin.

2024-11-14,BTC,Bitcoin,comment,1gqriuv,lx419zt,t1_lx2d3ul,,"I disagree that it’s equally possible it reflects previous cycles. Previous cycles had extremely low confidence in bitcoin as there wasn’t real regulatory approval and no approved investment vehicles. It could have been banned at any time, making its risk profile relatively high.

Now we’ve entered the stage where there is clarity and regulatory approval, which means the people who are entering the market are sophisticated and looking for outsized gains, if not to manipulate the market to own the max percentage possible.

What this means is they’ll look at previous cycles and use the confidence most people have in the market about timing against them. They will flood bad new stories and short bitcoin to plummet the price, thus confirming in the minds of the plebs that it’s going to be another huge bear market and they’ll shake them out and take their bitcoin while the plebs are waiting for it to go down enough and then buy back. 

But that won’t happen, it will shoot up in a “dead cat bounce” and then it will keep on going. And by the time it reaches an ATH maybe a year early, most of the dumb money that isn’t holding will have been shaken out and waiting for their dip and potentially never buy in or be forced to at much higher price points.

These investors are way more sophisticated and have way deeper pockets and connection to the media. They will take most of the bitcoin over time now that it has regulatory approval. You’re going to get fucked trying to time the market.

How do you do that remind me thing? Let’s throw a timer on for 3 years lol","I disagree that it’s equally possible it reflects previous cycles.

Hi everyone,

I’m 19 years old, and my life so far has been a storm I’m still trying to find my way out of. Both of my parents passed away when I was younger, leaving me to navigate this world on my own. Every day since then has been a a fight to finish school, to put food on the table, and to keep believing that tomorrow could be better.

I’m so close to finishing high school, even though life has thrown every obstacle in my way. There have been nights where I’ve stared at my textbooks in the dark because I couldn’t afford to keep the lights on. There have been mornings where I’ve walked hours just to get to class because I couldn’t pay for a bus. But I’ve pushed through because I believe there’s something greater waiting for me a future where I’m not just surviving but thriving.

Recently, I’ve discovered a passion for investing. I’ve poured what little I had into learning about Crypto and Trends and how to turn opportunities into something bigger. I know it sounds crazy, but I truly believe that with 0.15 Bitcoin about $10,000 I could change my life forever. I have a solid plan to invest and grow it into $100,000+ I’ve done the research, I’ve built a strategy, and I’ve poured my soul into understanding how this could work.

I know I’m asking for a lot from strangers, but this isn’t just about money it’s about a chance. A chance to build a life where I don’t have to struggle every single day. A chance to prove to myself that all the hardships I’ve endured weren’t for nothing.

If you can help, even just a little, I promise I won’t waste it. I’ll make this work, not just for me but for the people I hope to help someday when I’m in a position to give back. 

Thank you for reading this. Thank you for even considering it. And if you can’t give, that’s okay too just wish me luck, because I need all the hope I can get.

I took that and bought $500 worth of bitcoin for him.
He's not a computer guy at all.

A few other ppk in my family were 200% pisseed at me as if I was scamming him. Thus barrage of treatment and resent went on for weeks.

They insisted it was a terrible idea and I should have guided him to the families financial planner so he can place the $500 I to an index fund.

I took that and bought $500 worth of bitcoin for him.
He's not a computer guy at all.

A few other ppk in my family were 200% pisseed at me as if I was scamming him. Thus barrage of treatment and resent went on for weeks.

They insisted it was a terrible idea and I should have guided him to the families financial planner so he can place the $500 I to an index fund.

By now, we all know that 100k is no longer that mythical number we were just dreaming about. It's here, staring at us right in the face. However, every time I justify a pump, it looks that it's primarily driven by ETFs.

The question is would it have been possible to get here without Wall Street degens money?","By now, we all know that 100k is no longer that mythical number we were just dreaming about.

2024-11-25,BTC,Bitcoin,post,1gzwzzr,,,"Why would MicroStrategy purchase additional 50% of their holding at the peak, overpaying 100%. Are they leveraging / borrowing?","Why would MicroStrategy purchase additional 50% of their holding at the peak, overpaying 100%. Are they leveraging / borrowing?
So as most of us know, since 2020 MicroStrategy were consistently purchasing BTC and according to this website, they have held 252,220 BTC before November 2024. Until now, this seemed like very smart and wise DCA however what they have done this month is questionable.

In this month, November 2024 they have purchased 134,480 BTC which was over 50% of their entire holding of BTC as of the end of October 2024. Further they have paid for it over 10B which is more than they have paid for the 252,220 BTC that they have been acquiring over last 4 years or so.

Unless they are leveraging the gains of previously acquired BTC to get more BTC, their purchases from November 2024 or doing this to get publicity - this does not make sense to me. Why would they spend 100% of what they have been spending at ATH of BTC to get roughly 50% BTC when they believed in BTC all this time.

I would be grateful to hear your thoughts on this, maybe there is something to it that I don’t see.","So as most of us know, since 2020 MicroStrategy were consistently purchasing BTC and according to this website, they have held 252,220 BTC before November 2024.

You seem to be hung up on it being ""not fair that others don't know/ buy before others"". This is just life. Real estate & gold are literally no different, which are the largest assets by marketcap, BECAUSE they are the most scarce assets that existed up until now.

Just get a regular mortgage and pay it back out of your income. But many people might not be able to borrow that much.

Me for example, I have an okay amount saved in bitcoin, but if you were to look at my income and my outgoings you probably wouldn’t lend me even 1,000 bucks. When calculating your viability for a loan a regular mortgage lender will not take into account your magic internet money (at least that is what I have experienced).

With regards to making payments, I’m not sure I follow you completely, but the way I have described it, you would not really be getting a mortgage with monthly, you would basically be getting a big loan on your btc to buy a house outright for cash.

Eg, say you want to buy a house for 100,000. You give 2 btc to the provider as collateral and get a loan for 100,000, and use that money to buy the house. Now you own the house outright but have to service the loan. In one year you owe 115,000, but btc is worth 150,000. You could now pay off the loan and still have more left than if you had sold the btc to buy the house initially. Or just keep rolling over the loan, if btc keeps going up, you might pay it back in 5 year by only selling 0.1 btc. You don’t have regular ‘mortgage payments’ you just need to make sure there is always enough collateral to avoid margin calls/liquidation.

Of course I must emphasise again that you will be trusting your btc with a provider, so I would definitely not recommend doing this with a large portion of your stash, and you would have to be prepared to post more collateral if btc price crashes. But if you are happy taking that risk, and have high conviction in btc price rises, it can be worth doing.","So, I think if you have an income where a regular bank would lend you enough money to buy a house, that would probably be your best bet.

I thought I’d try it out and so glad I didn’t put in any more than $50 in. In the attached photo you can clearly see they charged me $140,000 rate AND took a service fee of $3. So basically, these sheisters kept the difference between the the market rate at transaction $98,579 and their “Sales Price” of $140,000 which was $41,421. After the $3.00 fee and this I ended up with about $33 of Bitcoin for my $50 deposit. Customer service was only available via text and that went nowhere.

We support pretty much all the models - ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Perplexity, Yi Lightning but also open-source and uncensored ones like Hermes, Lumimaid and other roleplay models, and practically any model you can think of. If you want one and we don't support it yet let us know, we'll add it.

We also have practically every image model supported. Recraft V3 is the current top of the leaderboard and it's our default model, we also support Flux Pro V1.1, Ideogram V2, Stable Diffusion V3.5 Large, SDXL, DALL-E, and allow you to turn off censoring on the models that support it by going into settings. We also have what is widely considered the best 18+ model in Promptchan.

Our service is built for privacy - we don't store any prompts or conversations, you can use our service even without making an account.

Minimum deposit is just $1, we used BTCPayServer to integrate Bitcoin. Superb service, can very much recommend it for anyone looking to accept BTC payments.

We love to see more actual usage of crypto and want to try and build more of a circular ecosystem around crypto, so we also have an Earn page to show people how to earn little bits of crypto. We'd love suggestions to add there for Bitcoin, so let us know which ones you think are best.

If anyone wants an invite with a bit of funds in it before depositing also let me know, will gladly send out a few invites if your Reddit account seems real.","Hi all! We've added Bitcoin as a payment option to www.nano-gpt.com.

I made some assumptions that turned out to be false, and there have been some painful moments, but in the end I'm glad I did it.  Nobody can time the market, but 

I think you need to keep a few things in mind:

1. Would you be okay if BTC went to zero (or even 50k)?  Can you afford to sell at a loss if you have to?
2. The timing might not work out.  BTC could jump to 100k, fall to 60, jump to 90, fall to 70, then plateau at 88 until AFTER you are hoping to buy a house.  It could also be up to 400k next fall. Who knows? (not us!)
3. Do you believe in the underlying principles of Bitcoin, or are you just trying to ride an appreciating asset for the short term?
4. If you have a spouse/partner, are they on board?

I don't currently have any regrets... but there have been times that I regretted my scheme. I apologized to my wife several times, but in the end, she's happy.

If you have to forecast your potential regrets, which would you regret more — taking the risk and losing $20k (assuming you sell at ~65k), or not taking the risk and losing out on $100k–200k profit?","You can read my post from three years ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/n9l5hs/pulled_the_trigger_my_401k_just_became_bitcoin/?ref=share&ref_source=link

When I see someone saying it can’t work it feels like people in the early days of the internet say it’s a fun idea but will never catch on because it’s too difficult to find anything.

Just because something doesn’t work 100% as you would wish now, doesn’t mean it can’t in the future. A new currency must first be a store a values, once that is established it can become a medium of exchange, and then finally a unit of account.

Does Bitcoin do all these things better than USD right now? No, not really. Does that mean it can never do these things? Of course not.

Tax in a lot of countries currently makes the everyday use of Bitcoin as a currency prohibitive, but when enough people own it this can change. It might take another 20, 30 or 40 years before Bitcoin is fully established as a currency that is viewed in the same way as usd, but we’ll get there.","When you’ve been into bitcoin for ten years it can feel like it’s been around forever and no progress is being made, but it’s important to remember that 15 years is not a very long time in terms of creating a new globally currency.

My ultimate goal would be not having to work and living off my savings, which will ultimately require exchanging Bitcoin for goods and services (or exchanging for fiat to pay for those goods and services) and I will be paying capital gains on every transaction. In a retirement scenario, I could theoretically take out a fiat loan backed by BTC, but I'd still need to regularly pay the interest and principal and I'd still be paying taxes when I convert BTC to fiat in order to pay for the loan. I would come out ahead if my loan term happens to coincide with a bull cycle, but otherwise, I could also easily come out worse. Considering how short bull runs in Bitcoin tend to be compared to the stagnant and bear periods, I'd generally rather not even worry about loans and convert BTC to fiat directly when I need it. In the US, I really don't see a good way to reliably leverage BTC backed fiat loans to avoid taxes. In general, I feel like the whole ""rich people use debt to avoid taxes"" theory is kind of a myth unless someone can explain how they avoid paying taxes on whatever income they're using to pay off the loans.","The ""fiat loan backed by BTC"" plan depends on adequate income to service the debt, which one would presumably still be paying taxes on.

Saylor is an obvious con artist, the guy don’t know shit about financial statement analysis, convertible debt or anything really.

I saw a recent interview where he compares his company to microsoft in terms of P/B ratios, which he is just straight up wrong in everything he says.

There is no reason for MSTR to trade at a premium relative to it’s book value, the company does not add any value to it’s shareholders outside of holding bitcoin, which anyone can do.

“Oh but the convertible debt instruments!!!”

You are regarded.

1- this debt will be converted and you will be diluted.

2- bitcoin will drop in price and the bondholders will have to be payed in cash, which means MSTR will sell the bitcoin they just bought by 100k at a lower value.

3- they will roll their debt with either a way worse conversion rate (diluting the shareholders more agressively) or with a much higher cost and stricter covenents.

Guten Abend r/Bitcoin,

nach jahrelangem halten mache ich mir grade Gedanken über einen Aussteig beim Erreichen eines gewissen Preiszieles bei Bitcoin :)

Nun meine Frage:
Welcher Exchange ist denn für den BTC->EUR Verkauf mit anschließender Banküberweisung hat denn die günstigsten Gebühren?

Bis jetzt habe ich alles über crypto com Exchange abgewickelt. Es geht aber um eine 6-stellige Summe und da spar ich mir gerne so viele Gebühren wie möglich!
